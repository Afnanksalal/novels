### Prologue

Yome, a young construction worker in his mid-twenties, trudges through life burdened by the monotony of his daily routine. With little education, no family, and only the backbreaking work on construction sites to keep him occupied, Yome watches enviously as his peers live out their vibrant lives. Every day blends into the next, until one fateful moment changes everything.

While working on a high-rise, Yome's safety rope snaps, sending him plummeting towards certain death. As he falls, a lifetime of regrets and unfulfilled dreams flash before his eyes. "Am I dead? Too soon? No, I was already living like a corpse... This is for the better," he muses. Just as he resigns himself to his fate, a blinding light envelops him.

A mystical voice echoes through the light, declaring, "Your story is just starting..."

Awakening in a fantastical world teeming with magic, mythical creatures, and ancient mysteries, Yome finds himself given a second chance. But this new realm is not without its own perils. As Yome navigates through enchanted forests, treacherous mountains, and forgotten ruins, he must uncover the secrets of a lost civilization and his own latent powers.

Haunted by his past and driven by an unyielding desire for purpose, Yome embarks on an epic journey of self-discovery, courage, and transformation. The road ahead is fraught with danger and wonder, where allies and enemies are not always as they seem.

In a land where the lines between legend and reality blur, Yome must rise to the challenge, or risk becoming a forgotten soul once more. "The Tale of the Forgotten Past" is a spellbinding adventure that explores the resilience of the human spirit, the quest for redemption, and the power of a second chance....

### Chapter 1: The Mysterious Fort and My Unique Skill

Yome's eyes flickered open to a dim, cold light. He groaned, feeling the chill of stone beneath him. As he sat up, a wave of confusion washed over him. The last thing he remembered was falling, the wind rushing past him, and then the light… the voice.

"Where am I?" he muttered, rubbing his temples. The room around him was vast, ancient, and crumbling. Tall, shadowy figures loomed over him — statues of warriors long forgotten. The air was heavy with the scent of dust and decay.

Yome staggered to his feet, noticing his clothes had changed. He wore a simple tunic and trousers, much different from his work clothes. His hands, once calloused and scarred from years of labor, now looked cleaner, stronger.

"What is this place?" he whispered, his voice echoing through the empty hall. He took a tentative step forward, the ground crunching beneath his feet. The hall opened into a vast chamber filled with rows of ancient bookshelves. Broken weapons and pieces of armor littered the floor.

"Hello?" he called out, but only silence answered.

He moved deeper into the chamber, every sound amplified in the eerie quiet. Suddenly, a noise made him spin around, heart pounding. A creature lunged from the shadows, its eyes gleaming with hunger. Yome grabbed a broken sword from the ground and swung it with all his might. The creature screeched and fell back, but others began to emerge from the darkness.

For three days, Yome fought for his life against these relentless monsters. Each encounter left him more exhausted and desperate. He scavenged for food and water, finding little sustenance among the ruins. Sleep was fitful, with nightmares of his fall and the voice haunting him.

On the third day, while searching for a safe place to rest, he stumbled upon a hidden door in the library. Pushing it open, he found a small, dimly lit room filled with ancient tomes and scrolls. At the center of the room, on a pedestal, lay a book unlike any other he had seen — a Grimoire.

"What's this?" Yome muttered, stepping closer. The book seemed to pulse with a faint, green light. He hesitated, then reached out and touched it. Instantly, the room was filled with a blinding light, and knowledge flooded his mind.

As the light faded, Yome found himself holding the Grimoire. He could feel its power, and his mind buzzed with new information. The Grimoire was a Base level, capable of holding six skills. And it was not just any Grimoire; it contained the element of wind.

"Skills… magic?" he murmured, flipping through the pages. He found descriptions of various spells and their mana consumption. One skill caught his eye: Predict. It was a rare ability that allowed him to predict an enemy's actions five seconds into the future, usable three times a day at the cost of 50 mana each time.

"This could save my life," he said, determination hardening his voice. He focused on the Grimoire, feeling a connection form between them. Mana coursed through him, and he realized he could now sense its flow within his body.

Suddenly, the Grimoire glowed brighter, and Yome felt a sharp pain in his chest. He gasped, dropping to his knees as visions of his past flashed before his eyes. Then, just as suddenly, the pain vanished. When he opened his eyes, he saw a new entry in the Grimoire: a unique skill.

"Status," he whispered, and a translucent screen appeared before his eyes.


**Name**: Yome

**Level**: 1

**Health**: 100/100

**Unique Skill**:

He stared at the screen in awe. "So, I'm really in a different world," he murmured. "A world with magic and… monsters." He glanced at the broken sword in his hand and then back at the Grimoire. "I need to learn more about this place."

Armed with his new knowledge, Yome ventured out of the library. The creatures were waiting, but this time he was prepared. He whispered the incantation for a wind blade, and a gust of sharp air sliced through the first monster.

"Yes!" he shouted triumphantly, but the fight was far from over. As more creatures charged, he used Predict to anticipate their movements. The world seemed to slow down, and he moved with newfound agility, dodging attacks and striking back with precision.

Despite his limited mana and the need for caution, Yome felt a spark of hope. For the first time since his fall, he believed he could survive.

After days of relentless battle, Yome finally found a place to rest in the abandoned city surrounding the fort. He set up camp in a small, sheltered courtyard, lighting a fire to keep the night's chill at bay.

As he stared into the flames, his mind raced with questions. "Why am I here? What is this world?" he wondered aloud. The voice that had spoken to him before his fall echoed in his memory. "Your story is just starting…"

"What story?" he muttered, frustration creeping into his voice. "I need answers."

Suddenly, a movement caught his eye. A shadowy figure stood at the edge of the courtyard, watching him. Yome's heart skipped a beat as he reached for his broken sword, ready for another fight.

"Who's there?" he called out, but the figure remained silent...

### Chapter 2: The Unknown Shadow

Yome's eyes were fixed on the shadowy figure at the edge of the courtyard. Heart pounding, he clutched his broken sword tightly, preparing for another fight. The figure moved with fluid grace, stepping into the dim light of the fire.

"Who's there?" Yome called out again, but the figure remained silent, its presence imposing and mysterious.

Fear mingled with determination as Yome charged at the shadow with all his might. "I won't go down without a fight!" he shouted, swinging his sword wildly. The figure dodged effortlessly, countering with precise strikes. Their blades clashed, creating sparks that illuminated their fierce battle.

Hours seemed to pass as they fought. Yome's muscles screamed in protest, his breath coming in ragged gasps. His mana was nearly depleted, the Predict skill having given him only slight advantages in predicting the figure's movements. Despite his best efforts, the figure's skill and agility were overwhelming.

Finally, with a swift strike, the shadowy figure disarmed Yome, sending his broken sword flying. Exhausted and defeated, Yome fell to the ground, gasping for breath. The figure stood over him, sword pointed directly at his face.

"Finish it," Yome panted, closing his eyes and bracing for the end.

Instead of a killing blow, he heard a soft rustle. Opening his eyes, Yome saw the figure removing a mask. He blinked in astonishment as a beautiful elf woman with crystal blue eyes, pointy ears, and long blonde hair appeared before him. She looked like a goddess, her presence both intimidating and captivating.

"Who are you?" she demanded, her voice sharp and clear. "And what are you doing in this abandoned city?"

Yome struggled to sit up, wincing in pain. "My name is Yome. I'm… I'm human."

The elf woman's eyes widened in shock. "Human? But humanity was wiped out long ago. How did you get here?"

"I don't know," Yome admitted, his voice trembling. "I was working on a construction site, fell, and then… I woke up here. I don't even know what this place is."

The elf woman's expression softened slightly. "I am Elara, a warrior of the Elven Tribes. We thought humans were extinct, along with many of our own kind, wiped out by the Demon King."

"Demon King?" Yome echoed, feeling a chill run down his spine.

Elara nodded. "Yes. He's a mysterious and powerful being. No one knows who he is or where he came from, but he unleashed chaos upon this world, filling it with deadly monsters and destroying entire civilizations. Only a few elf tribes and hybrids remain."

Yome felt a surge of despair. "So, I'm alone in a world filled with monsters?"

Elara's gaze softened further. "Not entirely alone. But we must hurry. It will be Blood Moon in a couple of hours. The monsters will become three times stronger and more aggressive. You won't survive here without protection."

She sheathed her sword and extended a hand to Yome. "Come with me. We need to leave this city and find a safer place."

Grateful and exhausted, Yome took her hand, allowing her to help him up. As they gathered their belongings, Yome glanced at Elara's Grimoire. It was a second-level Grimoire, fire element, radiating a powerful aura.

Elara glanced at Yome's broken sword and sighed. "We'll need to find you a proper weapon. This won't do."

Yome nodded, feeling a mix of gratitude and unease. "Thank you for helping me. I don't know what I would've done without you."

Elara smiled faintly. "We elves have a saying: 'In darkness, find the light.' Perhaps you are the light we need."

They packed their bags quickly, preparing to leave the city before the Blood Moon rose. As they moved through the crumbling streets, Yome couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope amidst the overwhelming uncertainty. He had found an ally in this strange new world, and together. They are stepping out of the abandoned city, the Blood Moon rising ominously in the sky, and the distant howls of monsters echoing through the night. Their journey had just begun, and the road ahead was fraught with danger and discovery...

### Chapter 3: The Blood Moon and the Bloodwolf Herd

The air was thick with tension as Yome and Elara made their way through the deserted city. The buildings around them were crumbling, remnants of a once-thriving civilization. Shadows danced in the corners of Yome's vision, making him jump at every small sound. 

As they walked, Yome couldn't help but ask questions, his curiosity burning despite the danger.

"Elara," Yome began, glancing at her. "What happened here? How did the humans and elves get wiped out? And who exactly is the Demon King?"

Elara's expression darkened as she prepared to respond, but before she could speak, a low growl echoed through the empty streets. Yome and Elara turned to see a herd of monstrous wolves with glowing red eyes emerging from the shadows. Their fur was dark and matted, and their teeth glowed with an eerie, fiery light.

"Bloodwolves!" Elara exclaimed, drawing her enchanted sword. "Stay close to me, Yome. These beasts are incredibly dangerous, especially under the Blood Moon."

Yome nodded, gripping his broken sword tightly. The wolves circled them, their growls growing louder. The leader of the pack lunged at Yome, but he managed to dodge just in time. Remembering his training over the past few days, he summoned his wind blade.

"Wind Blade!" Yome shouted, slashing at the nearest wolf. The gust of sharp air cut through the beast, making it yelp and fall back.

Elara engaged the other wolves, her sword blazing with fire. She moved with grace and precision, dispatching the monsters with ease. Yome was in awe of her skill, but he couldn't afford to be distracted. Another wolf lunged at him, and he quickly activated Wind Step to dodge the attack, moving with a burst of wind-powered speed.

"Gale Barrier!" he called out, forming a defensive shield of wind around himself as more wolves charged.

As Yome fought, he felt a surge of energy. He remembered his unique skill, Echo of the Fallen. Seeing an opportunity, he defeated one of the wolves and activated the skill.

"Echo of the Fallen!" he cried, feeling a rush of mana as he tried to absorb the wolf's power. A screen appeared before him, showing the new skill: Firebite. But as he tried to integrate it, he felt a sharp pain, and the skill was rejected.

"What's happening?" he gasped, his mana returning to normal as the absorption failed.

Elara noticed his struggle and shouted, "Yome, your Grimoire is wind-based! You can't use fire element skills with it!"

The remaining wolves seemed to sense their hesitation and attacked more fiercely. Yome gritted his teeth, focusing on his wind-based skills. He used Wind Blade and Gale Barrier repeatedly, his movements becoming more fluid and confident.

Elara, seeing Yome hold his ground, unleashed her powerful fire skills. "Flame Burst!" she shouted, sending a wave of fire that incinerated several wolves at once. The leader of the pack lunged at her, but she countered with Inferno Strike, burning it to ash.

Finally, the herd was defeated, their bodies littering the ground. Yome collapsed to his knees, exhausted and breathing heavily. Elara sheathed her sword and walked over to him.

"Are you alright?" she asked, helping him to his feet.

"I think so," Yome panted. "But why couldn't I use that skill? What's wrong with my Grimoire?"

Elara sighed and began to explain. "Your Grimoire is at the Base level and aligned with the wind element. At this level, you can only use skills related to that element. Echo of the Fallen allows you to absorb skills, but you can't use those that don't match your Grimoire's element."

"So I can only use wind skills?" Yome asked, feeling a bit disappointed.

"For now, yes," Elara confirmed. "As you level up your Grimoire, you'll be able to use more elements. Each level increases the number of skills you can hold and the variety of elements you can use. When you reach the next level, you can merge your Grimoire with another higher-level one, allowing you to use multiple elements."

Yome nodded, absorbing the information. "How do I level up my Grimoire?"

"You need to merge it with a higher-level Grimoire," Elara explained. "But it can't clash with your rank. As you gain experience and complete challenges, you'll earn the right to higher-ranked Grimoires."

Yome glanced at his Grimoire, feeling a mix of frustration and determination. "I'll get there," he vowed. "I'll become strong enough to use any skill I need."

Elara smiled at his resolve. "I believe you will. But for now, we need to keep moving. The Blood Moon is rising, and we're not safe yet."

They quickly gathered their belongings and set off again, making their way through the deserted streets. The city's eerie silence was occasionally broken by distant howls, reminding them of the dangers lurking in the shadows.

As they reached the midway point of their journey, Yome couldn't help but ask more questions. "Elara, can you tell me more about the Demon King?"

Elara's expression grew grim. "The Demon King is a powerful and mysterious entity. No one knows where he came from, but he unleashed chaos upon our world, filling it with deadly monsters and destroying entire civilizations. Most of humanity was wiped out, and many elf tribes were also decimated."

"Why does he do it?" Yome asked, his curiosity piqued.

"No one knows," Elara replied, her voice tinged with sadness. "Some say he seeks to control the world, others believe he revels in destruction. Whatever his motives, he's a threat to all living beings."

Yome felt a chill run down his spine. "And no one knows where he is?"

Elara shook her head. "Many have tried to find him, but none have succeeded."

They walked in silence for a while, the weight of the information heavy on Yome's mind. He glanced at Elara, admiring her strength and determination. Despite the bleakness of their situation, she remained resolute.

Finally, they reached the midway point of their journey, stopping to rest briefly. Elara handed Yome some food and water, which he accepted gratefully.

"We'll make it through this," Elara said, her voice filled with determination. "We have to."

Yome nodded, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. "We will. Together."

### Chapter 4: The Guild

The dawn was breaking, and the ominous red glow of the Blood Moon was fading. Yome and Elara continued their journey through the deserted city, the eerie silence occasionally broken by the distant howls of monsters. Exhaustion weighed heavily on them both, their mana reserves nearly depleted. Despite this, they pressed on, determined to find safety before the next wave of attacks.

As they navigated the crumbling streets, a variety of beasts and monsters sporadically appeared, forcing them into brief skirmishes. Elara's fire spells were becoming weaker, and Yome's wind abilities were barely sustaining them.

"Stay close, Yome," Elara instructed, her voice strained. "We're almost out of here."

Yome nodded, panting from exertion. "I don't know how much longer I can keep this up."

Just as hope seemed within reach, a massive, hulking figure emerged from the shadows—a Level B monster. Its eyes glowed with malevolence, and its roar shook the very ground they stood on.

"Run!" Elara shouted, grabbing Yome's arm. They sprinted through the labyrinth of broken buildings, the monster hot on their heels. Every step sent a jolt of fear through Yome, but he forced himself to keep moving.

They ducked into a narrow alley and found themselves in front of a dilapidated building. Desperate, they burst through the door and slammed it shut behind them. The monster's roars echoed outside, but it didn't seem to follow them inside.

Catching their breath, they realized they had stumbled into an old guild building. Dust and cobwebs covered the remnants of a once-bustling place. Broken furniture and shattered glass littered the floor, but there was an unmistakable sense of history in the air.

"What is this place?" Yome asked, looking around in awe.

Elara brushed some dust off an old emblem on the wall. "This used to be a guild hall. Adventurers would come here to form parties, take on quests, and level up. It was a place of camaraderie and challenge."

"Guilds?" Yome echoed. "What are they exactly?"

Elara smiled, despite their situation. "Guilds are organizations that adventurers join to take on missions and quests. They provide resources, training, and a place to gather. Members are ranked based on their experience and accomplishments. The ranks range from novice to master."

Yome's curiosity grew. "How do you become an adventurer?"

"You need to register with a guild using a registration artifact called a Register Ball," Elara explained. "It records your status, skills, and achievements, allowing you to level up and gain access to more powerful quests and resources."

As if on cue, a soft glow caught their attention. In the center of a broken table lay a glowing white ball. Elara's eyes widened in surprise. "That's a Register Ball! I can't believe it's still here."

They approached the table, and Elara picked up the ball, handing it to Yome. "Place your hand on it and state your name."

Yome did as instructed, feeling a warm sensation spread through his body as the ball recorded his information. A translucent screen appeared before his eyes.

Yome's eyes widened as he saw his level. "I leveled up! But how?"

Elara smiled, placing her hand on the Register Ball to update her status. "We gained experience from the monsters we defeated during the night. The Register Ball calculates and updates our levels based on our achievements."

Her own screen appeared:


**Name**: Elara

"We both leveled up significantly," Elara said, her tone one of cautious optimism. "This will help us survive."

They explored the guild hall further, discovering a cache of gear and supplies. Yome found a well-crafted sword and new clothes, replacing his worn and broken equipment. Elara handed him a set of leather armor that fit him surprisingly well.

"This should offer you better protection," she said, adjusting the armor on him.

Yome nodded, feeling more prepared. "Thank you, Elara. I don't know what I'd do without you."

"We're in this together," she replied, giving him a reassuring smile. "Now let's see what else we can find."

On a dusty shelf, they discovered potions and other supplies. Elara handed Yome several healing potions and mana potions, explaining their use.

"These will help you recover during battles. Healing potions restore health, and mana potions replenish your magical energy."

Yome stored the potions in his inventory, feeling more confident about their chances. "This place is a treasure trove," he remarked, looking around.

Elara nodded. "Old guild halls often have useful supplies left behind. We're lucky to have found this one."

With their newfound gear and resources, they decided to rest in the guild hall for the remainder of the day. They set up a small camp in one of the rooms, grateful for a moment of respite.

As Yome lay down, exhaustion finally overtook him. His thoughts swirled with the events of the past days—falling into a new world, fighting monsters, and discovering magic. Despite the fear and uncertainty, he felt a spark of hope. With Elara by his side, he believed they could survive and uncover the mysteries of this world. The dawn of a new day brought promise and peril in equal measure, but together, they were ready to face whatever lay ahead.

### Chapter 5: The Temple and the Abyss

The first light of dawn cast a warm glow over the deserted city, heralding the start of a new day. Yome and Elara had rested well in the safety of the old guild hall, their strength renewed. They gathered their belongings and prepared to continue their journey.

As they stepped out into the streets, Yome noticed an unusual calm. "There don't seem to be as many monsters around today," he remarked, looking around warily.

Elara nodded, her expression thoughtful. "It's because of the Blood Moon. Most monsters are exhausted after the night's frenzy and need to rest during the day to recover. We'll have a bit of respite, but we should still be cautious."

Yome listened intently as they walked, eager to learn more about this new world. "You mentioned something about cycles last night. Can you explain them to me?"

"Of course," Elara replied. "The day cycle affects the strength and behavior of monsters. During the day, they are generally weaker and less aggressive. At night, especially during a Blood Moon, they become much stronger and more dangerous."

"And what about mana?" Yome asked, curious.

"Mana has its own cycle as well," Elara explained. "During the day, mana regenerates more slowly. At night, the mana flow is stronger, especially during special events like the Blood Moon or a Mana Surge, when magical abilities are significantly enhanced."

As they continued their conversation, Yome couldn't help but notice Elara's height. She was tall and elegant, her long blonde hair catching the sunlight. "You're quite tall," he said, giving her a playful smile. "And, if I may say, very beautiful."

Elara blushed deeply, clearly flustered by the compliment. "Oh, um, thank you, Yome." In her embarrassment, she accidentally activated her Flame Burst skill. A burst of fire erupted around her, sending Yome flying into a nearby building with a crash.

"Oh no!" Elara exclaimed, rushing over to him. "Are you alright? I'm so sorry, Yome!"

Yome groaned, sitting up amid the rubble with a wry smile. "I'm fine, really. That was quite the compliment you returned."

Elara giggled nervously, helping him to his feet. "I need to be more careful. Let's check out this building. It looks like an old temple."

Yome nodded, brushing off the dust. They entered the temple, the air inside cool and still. The interior was dark and filled with ancient carvings and statues, some of which had crumbled with age.

"Should we look for loot?" Yome asked, glancing around the eerie space.

"Yes," Elara replied. "Old temples often have hidden treasures or artifacts. Let's see what we can find."

They explored the temple carefully, searching for anything valuable. As they moved through the halls, Yome asked, "Elara, why were you in the city?"

Elara's expression grew serious. "Well um... Several members of my tribe have gone missing recently. We fear they might have been captured or worse. I came here to search for any clues or signs of them. It's dangerous, but I had to try."

Yome felt a surge of admiration for her bravery. "Your tribe must be very important to you."

"They are," Elara said softly. "We live in a distant forest, hidden from most of the world. We've tried to maintain our way of life despite the dangers. Our history is long and filled with strife, but we've always endured."

As Elara spoke, they continued their search. They found a few ancient artifacts and some useful items, including a small cache of potions. Yome added them to their inventory, grateful for the extra supplies.

Just as they were about to leave, the floor beneath them creaked ominously. Before they could react, the ground gave way, and they plunged into a black abyss below.

Yome's heart raced as they fell, the darkness swallowing them. He reached out, trying to grasp anything to slow their descent, but it was futile. Elara's scream echoed in his ears, mingling with his own shout of fear.

### Chapter 6: The Dungeon of the Red Stone

Yome groaned as he slowly regained consciousness, his body aching from the fall. The darkness around him was oppressive, broken only by the faint glow of distant crystals embedded in the walls. As his senses returned, he became aware of something warm and soft pressing against his face. Blinking in confusion, he realized with a shock that Elara's chest was resting on him, her long blonde hair cascading over his shoulders.

His face flushed red in an instant. "W-What the—?!" Yome stammered, his voice barely a whisper.

Elara stirred at the sound, her eyelids fluttering open. As she registered their position, her eyes widened in horror, and she scrambled off him with a yelp. "I-I'm so sorry, Yome! I didn't mean to—"

"It's fine! Really, it's fine!" Yome quickly assured her, his own embarrassment just as evident. He sat up, trying to steady his racing heart. "It was just an accident. Let's not worry about it."

Elara, still blushing furiously, nodded in agreement. "Yes, let's… let's focus on our surroundings."

They both stood, taking a moment to assess where they had landed. The area was dimly lit by glowing crystals protruding from the walls, casting eerie shadows on the stone floor. The air was damp and cold, carrying the unmistakable scent of earth and decay.

"This looks like… a dungeon," Yome murmured, his voice tinged with unease.

Elara nodded, her eyes scanning the dark corridors that stretched out before them. "It seems so. But I can't tell what type of dungeon this is or how many monsters might be lurking within."

A faint, distant noise reached their ears—a low growl, followed by the sound of something dragging across the floor. Yome's stomach tightened in fear, and he gulped audibly. "Is there any way to get out of here without going deeper?" he asked, a note of desperation creeping into his voice.

Elara shook her head solemnly. "The only way out is through. We'll have to explore this dungeon and find an exit. But stay close to me, Yome. We don't know what dangers lie ahead."

Reluctantly, Yome nodded, gripping his newly acquired sword. "Okay… let's get moving."

They began their cautious descent into the dungeon, their footsteps echoing in the narrow corridors. The crystals lining the walls provided just enough light to reveal the path ahead, but the darkness beyond remained impenetrable.

As they ventured deeper, the faint glow of the crystals revealed more details of their surroundings. The walls were lined with ancient carvings, worn down by time, depicting scenes of battle and sacrifice. Yome's imagination ran wild, envisioning the horrors that might have taken place in these very halls.

Suddenly, they came across a small pack of goblins lurking in the shadows. The goblins were small, green-skinned creatures with sharp teeth and beady eyes. Most of them wielded crude weapons made of bone and stone. Yome tensed, his grip tightening on his sword.

"Goblins," Elara whispered, her voice steady. "They're low-level monsters. We can handle them."

Yome nodded, his confidence bolstered by her words. They moved forward, engaging the goblins in combat. Elara's sword blazed with fire as she cut through the creatures with ease, while Yome used his Wind Blade skill to slice through their ranks.

"Wind Blade!" Yome shouted, sending a gust of razor-sharp wind toward the goblins. The attack struck true, taking down two of the creatures in one swift motion. The remaining goblins snarled and charged, but they were no match for Elara's fire-based attacks.

As the last goblin fell, Yome noticed something unusual. One of the goblins, unlike the others, had used a wind-based attack during the fight. Goblins were typically associated with the earth element, so this anomaly caught his attention.

"That goblin… it was wind-type," Yome observed, intrigued.

Elara frowned. "That's unusual. Goblins are almost always earth-aligned. This one must have been mutated or exposed to some kind of magical influence."

Yome saw an opportunity. "Echo of the Fallen," he whispered, activating his unique skill. He focused on the fallen wind-type goblin, feeling the rush of mana as he attempted to absorb its knowledge.

A translucent screen appeared before him, revealing the new skill:


**Name**: Yome

**New Skill**: Wind Cutter (Wind Element) - A concentrated slash of wind that can cut through solid objects. (Mana Cost: 25)


"Got it," Yome said, a satisfied grin on his face. "Wind Cutter. This could come in handy."

They collected the loot from the defeated goblins, finding a few small items, including an ancient script. The parchment was old and worn, the text faded and written in an unknown language.

"This script… it's too old to decipher," Elara mused, examining the parchment closely. "But it could be important. We should hold onto it."

Yome nodded and placed the script into his inventory. "Maybe we'll find someone who can read it later."

They continued deeper into the dungeon, the air growing colder with each step. The dim light from the crystals flickered, casting eerie shadows that danced along the walls. The sense of foreboding grew stronger, and Yome couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched.

As they rounded a corner, they entered a vast chamber. At the center of the room stood a towering statue of an ancient warrior, its features worn and weathered by time. The statue's most striking feature was the large red stone embedded in its chest, glowing faintly in the dim light.

The floor around the statue was littered with old weapons, armor, and various treasures. Yome's eyes widened at the sight, his heart racing with excitement. "Look at all this loot!" he exclaimed, unable to contain his enthusiasm.

Elara's expression turned serious. "Yome, be careful. This could be a trap."

But Yome's excitement got the better of him. Ignoring Elara's warning, he rushed toward the treasures, his hands reaching out to grab the nearest items. The moment his fingers brushed against the loot, the red stone in the statue's chest flared to life, glowing a brilliant crimson.

The ground beneath them rumbled, and before they could react, the treasures vanished, and the chamber's doors slammed shut with a thunderous crash.

"Oh no…" Yome muttered, realizing his mistake. "I should have listened."

Elara drew her sword, her eyes scanning the room for threats. "Get ready, Yome. Something's coming."

Their fears were confirmed as the ceiling above them opened, and dozens of headless warrior armors dropped into the room. The suits of armor clanked and rattled as they stood, their weapons raised in a menacing display. Though headless, they moved with an eerie precision, like zombified soldiers.

"There are so many of them…" Yome whispered, fear gripping his heart.

The headless warriors charged, their weapons swinging with deadly force. Yome and Elara fought back with all their might, using their skills, weapons, and potions to fend off the relentless assault.

"Wind Blade!" Yome shouted, cutting through a line of warriors with a powerful gust of wind. But for every warrior they defeated, more seemed to take their place.

"Flame Burst!" Elara called out, unleashing a wave of fire that incinerated several warriors at once. But the strain was beginning to show—her mana was running low, and her movements were becoming sluggish.

The battle raged on, the chamber filled with the sounds of clashing metal and the groans of the undead. Yome's arms ached from swinging his sword, and his mana reserves were nearly depleted. Despite their best efforts, the sheer number of warriors was overwhelming.

"We can't keep this up!" Yome shouted, desperation in his voice.

Elara knew they were reaching their limits. Gritting her teeth, she decided to use her most powerful skill. "Dragon's Wrath!" she cried, her voice echoing through the chamber.

A surge of fiery energy erupted from Elara, enveloping her in a blazing aura. The flames intensified, forming the shape of a massive dragon that roared with fury. The dragon's fiery breath swept across the chamber, incinerating every headless warrior in its path.

The heat was intense, and Yome had to shield his eyes from the blinding light. When the flames finally subsided, the chamber was eerily silent. The headless warriors lay in smoldering heaps on the ground, their once-animated bodies now lifeless.

Elara collapsed to her knees, her energy completely spent. "I… I did it…" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Yome rushed to her side, supporting her as she struggled to stay upright. "You were amazing, Elara. But that was too much—are you okay?"

Elara gave him a weak smile. "I'll be fine… I just need to rest…"

Before they could catch their breath, they noticed the red stone in the statue's chest glowing even brighter. As they watched, the remaining headless warriors, which had not been caught in the initial blast, suddenly dropped to the ground, their weapons clattering as they fell.

"What's happening now?" Yome asked, his voice filled with apprehension.

"I don't know," Elara replied, her eyes fixed on the glowing stone. "But it feels like something's about to happen…"

### Chapter 7: The Stone of the Flaming Dragon

The chamber's atmosphere grew thick with tension as the red stone embedded in the statue's chest began to glow brighter and brighter, casting an eerie crimson light across the room. Yome and Elara instinctively backed away from the statue, the intensity of the light making it difficult to look directly at it.

"Elara, what's happening?" Yome asked, his voice laced with concern.

"I don't know," Elara replied, her gaze fixed on the glowing stone. "But whatever it is, it's powerful. Stay back, Yome. I'll handle this."

Suddenly, a deep, resonant voice echoed throughout the chamber, filling the space with an otherworldly presence: "The one who wields the will of the hero… The one who unleashes the dragon… I shall guide you to the steps of the forgotten past."

The statue began to tremble violently, as if awakening from a long slumber. Before either of them could react, the red stone dislodged itself from the statue's chest and flew directly towards Elara. She gasped as it embedded itself into her necklace, which now held the glowing red stone at its center.

A window appeared before them:


**Artifact Unlocked: Stone of the Flaming Dragon**
- Type: Fire
- Power: Unknown
- Skill: Unknown


Elara stared at the stone in awe, her breath catching in her throat. "It… it's become part of my necklace," she whispered, touching the stone gingerly. "But what does it do?"

Driven by curiosity and a sense of urgency, Elara attempted to channel her mana into the stone to activate its power. However, as soon as she did, a sharp pain shot through her body, causing her to cry out in agony. The stone greedily drained her mana, and another window appeared:


**You are too weak to use this artifact.**


"Stop! Elara, stop!" Yome shouted, rushing to her side as she trembled in pain. He caught her just as her legs gave out, lowering her gently to the ground.

"I… I can't control it…" Elara gasped, her voice trembling as the pain finally subsided. The stone's glow dimmed, but it remained embedded in her necklace, a constant reminder of its mysterious power.

Yome quickly pulled out a health potion and a mana potion from his inventory, handing them to her. "Here, drink these. You need to recover."

Elara nodded weakly, accepting the potions with shaking hands. She drank them slowly, the effects gradually restoring her health and mana. Yome watched her closely, concern etched on his face.

After a few moments, she sighed deeply, feeling the potions' effects take hold. "Thank you, Yome. I'm sorry… I shouldn't have tried to use it."

"Don't apologize," Yome said gently, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "You couldn't have known what would happen. But we need to be careful with this artifact. It's clearly more powerful than we can handle right now."

Elara nodded, her expression somber. "You're right. We'll need to figure out how to control it, but for now… I'll keep it sealed."

They took a moment to rest and regroup, their bodies still weary from the intense battle and the strain of the artifact. Despite their fatigue, they knew they couldn't stay in the dungeon much longer. The ancient structure felt unstable, as if it could collapse at any moment.

"We should gather whatever loot we can and get out of here," Yome suggested, his voice steady despite his exhaustion.

Elara agreed, and together they began searching the chamber for any valuables. The battle with the headless warriors had left the room in disarray, but they managed to find several items of interest:

- Enchanted Gear: A set of armor pieces imbued with protective magic, enhancing their defense and agility.
- Gold Coins: A sizable amount of gold, likely from past adventurers who had perished in the dungeon.
- Ancient Scripts: More pieces of parchment filled with unknown symbols and text, too old and faded to decipher.
- Health Artifact: A small amulet that passively increases the rate of health regeneration.

Yome carefully added the items to his inventory, ensuring they didn't miss anything valuable. "These should come in handy," he said, admiring the enchanted gear before storing it away.

Elara nodded, her strength slowly returning. "Yes, they will. But we should be quick. I have a bad feeling about this place."

No sooner had the words left her mouth than the ground beneath them began to shake. Dust and debris fell from the ceiling as the walls of the chamber started to crack.

"The dungeon's collapsing!" Yome shouted, panic rising in his chest.

Suddenly, a new window appeared before them:


**Activating Safe Teleport…**


Without warning, a soft glow enveloped both Yome and Elara. The light grew brighter until it consumed them entirely, and in the next instant, they found themselves standing outside the dungeon, at the entrance of the temple.

The artifact that had triggered the teleportation glowed one last time before disintegrating into nothingness, leaving behind only the faintest trace of mana.

Yome let out a long sigh of relief, his legs nearly giving way beneath him. "We're out… Thank the gods, we're out."

Elara, still shaken from the ordeal, nodded in agreement. "That was close. Too close."

They took a moment to catch their breath, the cool night air a stark contrast to the oppressive atmosphere of the dungeon. The city lay quiet around them, the ruins bathed in the pale light of the rising moon.

"We've been in that dungeon for a while," Yome remarked, glancing at the sky. "I lost track of time in there."

Elara agreed, her gaze fixed on the forest that lay beyond the city's borders. "Let's move. We need to put some distance between us and the dungeon."

The pair crossed the city's border, leaving the ruins behind as they entered the dense forest. The trees were tall and ancient, their leaves rustling softly in the wind. A strange energy permeated the air, the mana so thick that Yome could almost feel it pressing against his skin.

"This forest… it's leaking a lot of mana," Yome observed, a shiver running down his spine. "It's making me nervous."

Elara's expression grew serious. "This is an old forest, one that's been untouched for centuries. The mana here is dense because it hasn't been disturbed. It can be both a blessing and a curse."

They continued their journey in silence, the only sounds being the soft crunch of leaves underfoot and the distant calls of nocturnal creatures. Despite the tranquility of the forest, Yome couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

He glanced at Elara and noticed the troubled look on her face. "Elara, are you alright? You've been quiet since we left the dungeon."

Elara hesitated before responding, her voice barely above a whisper. "When the stone embedded itself in my necklace, I saw something… something terrible."

Yome's brow furrowed with concern. "What did you see?"

Elara's eyes filled with a mix of fear and sorrow as she recounted her vision. "I saw a city in flames. Elves, humans… all screaming in fear and pain. Corpses littered the streets, their bodies torn apart by monstrous creatures. Children were running for their lives, but there was no escape. The monsters… they slaughtered everyone with no mercy."

Her voice trembled as she continued. "I saw an elf woman… She was bleeding heavily, one arm severed at the elbow. In her remaining hand, she held a broken sword, her eyes filled with despair. I think… I think it was a memory from the past. The past of the Demon King… but who was that woman? And why did the stone speak of a hero?"

Yome's heart ached for her as she struggled with the horrific vision. He placed a comforting hand on her shoulder, his voice gentle. "Elara, I can't imagine what you saw, but we'll figure this out. We'll learn more about this stone and the past… but for now, try not to dwell on it too much. Focus on your goal—finding your lost tribe members."

Elara nodded, though her expression remained haunted. "You're right. I need to stay strong, for their sake. Thank you, Yome."

As they continued through the forest, they eventually came across a small clearing by a lake. The water was still and reflective, mirroring the bright, full moon that hung high in the sky. The sight was serene, offering a brief moment of peace after the chaos they had endured.

"This looks like a good spot to rest," Yome suggested, already feeling the exhaustion from the day's events weighing on him.

Elara agreed, and they set up a small camp near the lake's edge. The cool breeze off the water was refreshing, and the sounds of the forest at night provided a calming backdrop.

They sat by the campfire, eating a simple dinner of dried meat and bread. Yome's mind wandered as he chewed, replaying the events of the day in his head. The battles, the discovery of the red stone, Elara's vision—it all seemed too much to take in.

To distract himself, he opened his inventory and began checking through the items they had collected in the dungeon. The enchanted gear they had found would serve them well in the future, and the health artifact was already making a difference in his recovery.

As Yome scrolled through his inventory, a sudden rustling sound came from the nearby bushes, breaking the serene atmosphere of the night. His head snapped up, eyes narrowing in the direction of the noise. The fire crackled softly, but all other sounds of the forest seemed to fall silent, as if the world itself was holding its breath.

"Elara," Yome whispered, his voice low and tense. "Did you hear that?"

Elara, who had been lost in thought, instantly snapped to attention. Her hand instinctively went to her sword, and her eyes scanned the darkness surrounding their camp. The rustling grew louder, more insistent, as if something—or someone—was moving toward them with purpose.

Yome stood slowly, careful not to make any sudden movements that might provoke whatever was out there. "Stay close to the fire," he murmured, trying to keep his voice steady. "It might be just an animal, but we can't take any chances."

Elara nodded, her expression calm but focused. "We've been through worse," she said, trying to offer some reassurance. "But let's be ready for anything."

The bushes rustled again, this time accompanied by a low growl. Yome tightened his grip on his sword, his mind racing. They had fought off goblins, headless warriors, and who knew what else in that dungeon. But out here, in the open, with their energy still sapped from the day's battles, the situation felt different. 

Elara shifted her stance, positioning herself between Yome and the direction of the sound. Her presence was both comforting and commanding, a silent reminder of the strength she possessed even after all they had endured. Yome, feeling a rush of determination, stood beside her, ready to face whatever emerged from the darkness.

The growl grew louder, more menacing, and then, without warning, a figure burst out of the bushes—a large, wolf-like creature with eyes that glowed an unnatural red. Its fur was matted and dark, and its fangs gleamed in the firelight as it snarled, baring its teeth at the two adventurers.

"A Bloodwolf," Elara hissed, recognizing the beast. "It's still lingering from the Blood Moon."

Yome's heart pounded in his chest. The last time they encountered these creatures, they had barely escaped with their lives. He quickly glanced at his mana reserves, knowing they were still low from the day's trials. There wasn't much left to draw from, but he had no choice.

"Elara, we need to take it down fast," Yome said, his voice firm despite the fear gnawing at him. "We can't afford a prolonged fight."

Elara nodded, already preparing herself for the battle. "Stay behind me and strike when you see an opening. I'll try to weaken it."

The Bloodwolf lunged, its claws extended and its jaws snapping with deadly intent. Elara was quicker, her enchanted sword blazing as she met the beast head-on. Sparks flew as their weapons clashed, and the Bloodwolf howled in pain as Elara's blade sliced through its fur.

Yome circled around, looking for an opportunity to strike. The wolf's movements were swift, almost too fast for him to keep up with, but he knew he had to act. With a surge of determination, he activated his "Wind Step", using the burst of speed to close the gap between him and the creature.

"Wind Blade!" Yome shouted, slashing at the Bloodwolf's side with all his strength. The gust of wind cut through the beast's flesh, drawing a deep wound that caused it to stagger.

But the Bloodwolf wasn't done yet. It turned on Yome with a vicious snarl, its glowing eyes filled with fury. Before it could strike, Elara was there, her sword flashing in the firelight as she delivered a powerful blow to the creature's head.

The Bloodwolf howled in agony, its body convulsing before it finally collapsed to the ground, defeated. Yome stood over it, breathing heavily, his heart still racing from the intensity of the fight.

"Is it dead?" he asked, not daring to lower his guard just yet.

Elara knelt beside the beast, inspecting it closely. After a moment, she nodded. "Yes, it's dead. But we need to stay vigilant. There could be more nearby."

Yome nodded, feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over him. "That was close… too close."

Elara placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. "You did well, Yome. We both did."

They took a moment to catch their breath, the tension slowly ebbing away as the adrenaline wore off. The campfire crackled softly, its warm light a stark contrast to the darkness that surrounded them.

"What do you think it was doing here?" Yome asked, breaking the silence. "I thought the Blood Moon's effect was over."

Elara shook her head, her expression thoughtful. "The Blood Moon may have passed, but some creatures are more resilient. They can linger for days, especially if they're particularly strong or stubborn. We need to be careful."

Yome nodded, grateful for her wisdom. "We should get some rest. We've been through a lot today, and we'll need our strength for whatever comes next."

Elara agreed, though she kept a wary eye on the forest. "We'll take turns keeping watch. Just in case."

They settled back by the fire, the tension from the battle still lingering but gradually fading into the background as the night wore on. The forest around them remained quiet, the only sound being the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.

As Yome lay down, trying to relax, he couldn't help but replay the events of the day in his mind. The dungeon, the red stone, the vision Elara had seen—it all felt like pieces of a much larger puzzle, one that they had only just begun to unravel.

He glanced at Elara, who was keeping watch with a calm but vigilant expression. Despite everything, she remained a steady presence, a beacon of strength and determination. Yome felt a deep sense of gratitude toward her, knowing that without her, he wouldn't have made it this far.

As he drifted off to sleep, Yome couldn't shake the feeling that their journey was only going to get more dangerous from here. But for now, at least, they were safe. And that was enough...

### Chapter 8: The Quest for the Core

Yome awoke to the soft light of dawn filtering through the canopy of the dense forest. The morning air was cool and fresh, carrying the scent of earth and leaves. He sat up slowly, blinking the sleep from his eyes, and glanced around their campsite. The fire had long since died out, leaving only a faint wisp of smoke curling up into the sky.

To his surprise, he saw Elara sitting a short distance away, her back against a tree, her sword resting across her lap. She had been keeping watch, and from the look of her, she hadn’t slept much, if at all. Her eyes were closed, her breathing slow and steady, but there was a tiredness in the way she slumped against the tree.

Yome’s heart sank a little. He felt a pang of guilt as he realized how much she had been doing to protect them both, while he had been the one to rest. He silently berated himself for not being strong enough to share the burden more equally.

“Elara,” he called softly, trying not to startle her.

Her eyes fluttered open at the sound of his voice, and she offered him a weary smile. “Good morning, Yome.”

“Good morning,” he replied, walking over to her. “You didn’t sleep, did you?”

She shook her head lightly. “I was just resting my eyes. I wanted to make sure nothing snuck up on us during the night.”

Yome frowned, feeling that familiar pang of inadequacy. “I should have been the one keeping watch. You’ve been doing so much, and I… I’ve been relying on you too much.”

Elara’s expression softened, and she reached out to gently touch his arm. “Yome, you’re doing fine. We’re in this together, remember? You’ve saved us both more than once, and you’ve been learning quickly. Don’t be too hard on yourself.”

He gave her a small, grateful smile, though the feeling of inadequacy lingered. “Here, let me at least get us some food,” he said, moving to his pack. He pulled out some dried meat and bread, offering it to her.

“Thank you,” Elara said, accepting the food. They ate in comfortable silence, the forest around them slowly coming to life with the sounds of birds and rustling leaves.

After their meal, Elara stretched and stood up, her movements fluid despite her exhaustion. “I think we should freshen up before we continue. There’s a lake nearby that we can use to wash up.”

Yome nodded, packing up the rest of their supplies. “Good idea. I could use a wash after everything we’ve been through.”

They made their way to the lake, the water’s surface glistening in the morning light. Elara smiled as she stepped toward the water’s edge, slipping off her armor and setting her sword down carefully on the shore.

“I’ll take a quick bath,” she said, turning to Yome with a playful smile. “You can keep watch this time.”

Yome chuckled, giving her a thumbs-up. “Don’t worry, I’ll stay right here.”

Elara stepped into the lake, the water lapping gently at her legs as she waded in deeper. Yome turned his back to give her privacy, focusing on the surrounding forest and listening for any signs of danger. The morning was peaceful, the birds chirping cheerfully in the trees.

But as Yome stood there, his gaze drifted back toward the lake. He caught a glimpse of Elara’s back as she let her long, golden hair fall loose over her shoulders. His eyes widened as he noticed something he hadn’t seen before—a strange mark on the back of her neck, just below her hairline. It was partially obscured by her hair, which explained why he hadn’t noticed it earlier.

Curiosity piqued, Yome took a hesitant step toward the water. “Elara, what’s that mark on the back of your neck?”

Before he could get any closer, Elara turned around sharply, her eyes narrowing. “Yome, are you trying to peek at me while I’m bathing?” she accused, her voice a mixture of shock and indignation.

Yome’s face turned beet red, and he immediately threw his hands up in surrender. “No, no! It’s not like that! I swear, I wasn’t trying to peek—I just noticed something on your neck, that’s all!”

Elara’s eyes softened slightly, though she still looked embarrassed. “You could have waited until I was dressed, you know,” she muttered, shooing him away. “Now, go over there and stop looking this way until I’m done.”

Yome retreated quickly, still mortified by the misunderstanding. He sat down on a rock by the shore, his back to the lake, and waited until he heard Elara stepping out of the water.

A few minutes later, Elara called out, “You can turn around now.”

Yome turned cautiously, relieved to see that she was fully dressed, her hair now tied up. He scratched the back of his head awkwardly. “I’m really sorry about that, Elara. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”

Elara sighed, her irritation melting away. “It’s alright, Yome. I know you didn’t mean anything by it. But next time, just ask me when I’m not in the middle of a bath, okay?”

“Deal,” Yome said with a sheepish grin. “But, seriously, what is that mark on your neck? It looked… different.”

Elara touched the back of her neck, her expression thoughtful. “Oh, that. It’s my tribe’s mark. Each member of the tribe has one—it’s a symbol of our connection to the forest and the mana that flows through it.”

Yome’s curiosity deepened. “Can you tell me more about your tribe?”

Elara nodded, sitting down beside him. “My tribe is one of the last surviving elven communities. We live deep within a forest that is hidden from the rest of the world. Our lives are deeply connected to nature and the mana that flows through the land. It’s our duty to protect the balance of the forest and ensure that the mana doesn’t grow too wild.”

She hesitated for a moment, then continued. “We have an elf queen, though no one has seen her in years. She lives inside the Sacred Tree, a massive tree at the center of our forest. It’s said that the Sacred Tree is the source of our mana and that the queen protects it. But with her absence, things have started to change.”

“What do you mean?” Yome asked, sensing the weight in her words.

Elara’s expression grew troubled. “Without the queen’s guidance, the balance of mana in the forest has begun to shift. Monsters have started appearing more frequently, and they’ve grown more aggressive. My tribe has always been responsible for keeping the mana in check, but we’re not strong enough to control it on our own.”

She sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly. “Some of our people decided to venture out and find help, but they never returned. I’m the daughter of the village guard captain, and I was tasked with finding them… if they’re still alive. Our tribe’s numbers are dwindling, Yome. If I don’t succeed, I’m afraid we might not survive.”

Yome felt a deep sense of empathy for her plight. He could see the weight of responsibility she carried, and it made him even more determined to help her. He placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder, offering her a gentle smile. “Elara, we’ll find them. We’ll find your people and bring them back. You’re not alone in this.”

Elara looked at him, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. “Thank you, Yome. It means a lot to hear that.”

She wiped her eyes and then, with a small smile, asked, “What about you? I know you’ve mentioned bits and pieces, but… can you tell me more about your past?”

Yome hesitated, the memories of his previous life flooding back. He had tried to push those thoughts aside since arriving in this new world, but now, sitting here with Elara, he felt he could share his story.

He took a deep breath and began, “My life back in my world… it wasn’t anything special. My parents died when I was young, and after that, everything just kind of fell apart. I dropped out of school because I couldn’t afford it, and I ended up working as a construction worker. It was hard work, and I never really got anywhere. I was just… existing. Day after day, doing the same thing, with no real purpose.”

Elara listened intently, her eyes filled with empathy as Yome continued. “I didn’t have anyone to rely on, and I didn’t really know what I was doing with my life. It felt like I was just wasting away, with nothing to look forward to. And then… well, you know what happened. I fell, and the next thing I knew, I was here.”

He gave a small, bitter laugh. “It’s strange, isn’t it? My life was so miserable, and now… now I’m in a world full of magic and monsters. But at least here, I feel like I have a purpose. Like I can actually make a difference.”

Elara reached out and patted his shoulder gently. “You’ve been through a lot, Yome. But like you said, your life has restarted here. You have a chance to make it whatever you want it to be. And you’re not alone anymore.”

Yome felt a warmth in his chest at her words. “Thanks, Elara. That means a lot.”



They sat together in companionable silence for a while, watching the sun rise higher in the sky. Eventually, they stood and began packing up their camp, preparing to continue their journey.

As they walked through the forest, they came across a broken statue half-buried in the undergrowth. The statue was weathered and worn, but it still held a certain aura of power. Yome noticed a faint glow emanating from the base of the statue, and he pointed it out to Elara.

“What’s that?” Yome asked, curious.

Elara’s eyes widened in recognition. “That’s a waypoint. We can use it to teleport quickly from one location to another. They’re rare, but incredibly useful.”

Yome’s interest was piqued. “How does it work?”

Elara approached the statue, examining it closely. “Waypoints can be activated and registered to specific users. Once registered, you can use them up to three times a day to travel between other waypoints. It’s like having a fast travel system. But we’ll need to register ourselves to this waypoint first.”

She placed her hand on the glowing stone at the base of the statue and began the registration process. As she did, a window suddenly appeared before them:


**Quest Available: Find the Core**
- **Objective:** Locate and retrieve the core to activate this waypoint.
- **Reward:** Mystery Reward


Elara frowned, her brows furrowing in confusion. “A quest? But… we didn’t register as a party, did we?”

Yome looked puzzled as well. “No, we didn’t. But maybe… it’s because we checked our status at the same time in the guild? Maybe the Register Ball automatically registered us as a party.”

Elara nodded thoughtfully. “That could be it. The Register Ball might have recorded us as a party when we both checked our status. That would explain why we’re getting a party quest now.”

She quickly accessed her status screen, navigating to a different page where party details were listed. Sure enough, there it was:


**Party Name:** [Unregistered]
- **Party Members:**
  - Elara (Level 18)
  - Yome (Level 5)


Elara showed Yome the screen, confirming their suspicions. “Looks like we are officially a party, even if we didn’t intend to be.”

Yome grinned, feeling a small surge of pride. “Well, in that case, let’s accept the quest. We need to find the core to activate this waypoint anyway.”

Elara smiled, sharing in his determination. “Agreed. Let’s do this.”

They both selected “Accept” on the quest window, and the screen disappeared, replaced by a new objective marker on their map.


**Quest Accepted: Find the Core**
- **Objective:** Locate and retrieve the core to activate this waypoint.
- **Reward:** Mystery Reward

### Chapter 9: The Mountain of The Crying Angels

The decision had been made. Yome and Elara had accepted the mysterious quest to find the lost core, even though they had little idea what awaited them. The cryptic message that accompanied the quest had been vague at best, yet it seemed to hold a deeper meaning.

"The place where the angel weeps for the fallen god… Where tears gather upon the mountains… there shall you find it."

Elara stared at the quest details, her brow furrowed in thought. "The crying angels… I think I know the place," she murmured, almost to herself. 

Yome, standing beside her, caught the seriousness in her tone. "You do? Where is it?"

Elara hesitated, her mind clearly running through possible scenarios. "It's up in the mountains, at the very edge of this forest. But to get there, we'll have to cross the swamp that lies at the forest's center."

Yome's curiosity was piqued, but he couldn't help the slight shiver that ran down his spine. "A swamp? That doesn't sound too bad, right? I mean, how hard can it be to cross a swamp?"

Elara shook her head, her expression serious. "This isn't just any swamp, Yome. It's home to witches and is surrounded by werewolves."

Yome's eyes widened in surprise. "Witches and werewolves? That's… a little more intense than I was expecting."

Elara nodded, her gaze unwavering. "The witches are powerful, and the werewolves are fierce. They've been isolated in that swamp for centuries, cut off from most of the world. The thing is, they have a deep-seated hatred for humans. Long ago, humans hunted them down, killing them without mercy. They've never forgotten that, and if they see you… they'll take their revenge."

Yome swallowed hard, the gravity of the situation sinking in. "So, they'll be fine with you, but not me."

"Exactly," Elara said. "As an elf, I can probably talk to them, or at least avoid a direct confrontation. But for you, it's going to be dangerous."

Yome felt a wave of fear wash over him, but Elara quickly added, "Don't worry, Yome. I'll protect you."

Her reassurance helped calm him a bit, and he managed a small smile. "Thanks, Elara. I appreciate it."

Elara returned the smile but then grew serious again. "Our first goal is to reach the swamp. It's not just a straight path, though. This forest is filled with monsters, and if we travel on foot, it'll take us about three days to reach the edge."

Yome looked around at the forest, now fully bathed in morning light. The birds were chirping, and the air was fresh and crisp. The beauty of the place struck him. "This place is marvelous," he said, almost in awe.

Elara smiled softly. "It is beautiful. But if you think this is something, you should see the elf forest where I come from. It would leave you speechless." She winked playfully.

Yome chuckled. "I can't wait to see it."

With their course set, they began their journey through the dense forest. The day passed with them hunting for food, exploring the forest's wonders, and collecting various herbs and items. They moved cautiously, always alert for any sign of danger. 

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the forest floor, they found a suitable spot to camp near a large rock cave. Elara was visibly tired, her movements slower than usual. 

"You should get some rest, Elara," Yome suggested. "I'll take the first watch."

Elara nodded, too tired to argue. "Alright. But wake me if anything happens." She settled down near the campfire, using her pack as a pillow.

As Yome sat by the fire, he couldn't help but admire Elara. Her beauty, her strength, her unwavering determination—everything about her captivated him. The way her long hair framed her face, the softness of her lips, the grace in her every movement, even in sleep, was mesmerizing. But it wasn't just her physical beauty that drew him in; it was her spirit, her warrior's heart, and her fierce loyalty. She was unlike anyone he had ever met.

His thoughts were interrupted by a faint sound in the distance. It was barely audible, but it was there—"H-help… somebody h-help me…"

Yome's heart skipped a beat. He grabbed a torch, quickly lighting it, and strained his eyes to see through the darkness. There, in the distance, he could make out a figure stumbling toward them.

"Elara, wake up!" Yome hissed urgently, shaking her shoulder. "Someone's coming!"

Elara was instantly awake, her hand on her sword as she rose to her feet. They both stood in a fighting stance, ready for whatever was approaching.

As the figure drew closer, they saw it was a young girl—no, not a girl exactly. She had cat-like ears and a tail, and her body was covered in wounds. Her clothes were torn, and she was bleeding heavily. With a final, desperate step, she collapsed in front of them.

"A neko," Elara gasped, rushing forward to help. She quickly knelt beside the girl, pulling out a healing potion from her pack. Yome followed, helping to patch up her wounds.

After administering the potion and wrapping her in bandages, they laid her down near the fire to rest. Yome dug through his inventory, pulling out an old adventurer's outfit he had acquired earlier. He gently placed it over her, providing some much-needed warmth and protection.

Once the neko was settled, Yome turned to Elara. "Who is she?"

Elara's face was filled with concern. "She's a neko. They're a race that lives in the Blossom Garden, which is at the top of the Mountain of Crying Angels. But what is she doing here? And why is she hurt so badly?"

Yome looked back at the unconscious neko, his mind swirling with questions. "The Mountain of Crying Angels… that's where we're headed for the quest, right?"

"Yes," Elara replied, her voice tinged with unease. "But the neko shouldn't be here, especially not in this condition. Something's very wrong."

They both fell silent, their thoughts filled with worry and confusion. The neko's appearance raised more questions than it answered. What had happened to her? Why was she so far from her home? And what dangers lay ahead for Yome and Elara as they ventured closer to the Mountain of Crying Angels?

### Chapter 10: The Neko's Tale

The morning sun filtered through the dense canopy of the forest, casting dappled patterns of light and shadow across the ground. The soft chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves in the breeze created a tranquil atmosphere, belying the tension that lay between the trees. Yome and Elara sat beside the campfire, the embers of which were still glowing faintly from the night before. 

The figure of the neko girl stirred slightly in her makeshift bed. Her delicate ears twitched, catching the sounds around her as she began to wake. Elara, who had been sitting quietly, keeping watch, noticed the movement and leaned forward slightly, ready to reassure the girl when she opened her eyes.

The neko blinked, her large, amber eyes fluttering open. She sat up suddenly, panic flashing across her face as she looked around, taking in her unfamiliar surroundings. Her gaze landed on Yome and Elara, and she immediately shrank back, her body tense with fear.

"Hey, hey, it's okay," Elara said gently, raising her hands to show she meant no harm. "You're safe here. We found you last night, injured and unconscious. We just want to help."

The neko's ears flattened against her head as she eyed them warily. "W-Who are you? What do you want from me?"

Yome, who had been sitting quietly by the fire, offered her a kind smile. "We're travelers, just like you. My name's Yome, and this is Elara. We saw you were hurt and couldn't just leave you out there."

Elara nodded in agreement. "You're safe now. We just want to make sure you're okay. Can you tell us your name?"

The neko hesitated for a moment before softly replying, "I'm Neri. I… I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude on your camp."

Elara shook her head, smiling warmly. "You didn't intrude. We're just glad we found you before anything worse could happen."

Neri's tense posture relaxed slightly, but she was still on edge, her eyes darting around as if expecting danger to leap out at any moment. Elara noticed this and decided it was time to get some answers. "Neri, can you tell us what happened? Why were you out here all alone in the middle of the night?"

Neri lowered her gaze, her expression turning somber. "I was looking for herbs… My village is at the Blossom Garden, high up in the mountains. We depend on rare herbs that grow in the lower forests. I came down here to gather some. It started to rain, and I got lost, deeper in the forest than I intended. Night fell faster than I expected, and then…" Her voice trailed off, and she shivered at the memory.

Yome leaned in, concern etched on his face. "And then what? What happened?"

Neri's voice was barely a whisper as she continued. "The Bloodmoon… it rose in the sky, and with it, the forest changed. The creatures… they went mad, driven into a frenzy by the moon's power. I tried to run, but… but the werewolves were out of control. They were everywhere, hunting, howling, tearing through the forest. I barely escaped with my life."

Yome's heart ached at the fear in her voice. "That sounds terrifying. You're lucky to have made it out at all."

Neri nodded, her eyes misty. "I thought I was going to die. They were so close, I could feel their breath on my neck. But somehow, I managed to outrun them, though not without getting injured. I don't even remember how I ended up here… I just kept running until I couldn't anymore."

Elara reached out, gently placing a hand on Neri's shoulder. "You're safe now. We'll help you get back to Blossom Garden. No more running alone through dangerous woods, okay?"

Neri's eyes softened as she looked at Elara, gratitude filling her gaze. "Thank you… Thank you so much."

Yome, who had been listening intently, spoke up again. "Neri, we're heading towards the mountains ourselves. If you're okay with it, you can travel with us. We'll make sure you get home safely."

Neri's eyes brightened at the offer. "You'd do that for me? Really?"

"Of course," Yome said, smiling. "It's not safe out here. We're all in this together now."

Elara nodded in agreement, adding, "And besides, having someone as skilled as you could be a huge help. I've heard nekos have some powerful magic."

Neri's ears perked up slightly at the compliment, though she looked a bit embarrassed. "W-We do have some magic, yes… It's passed down through our tribes, ancient spells that don't need grimoires. My family has protected the secrets of our magic for generations."

Elara's eyes gleamed with interest. "Really? That's fascinating. Some elves have similar abilities, though not all of us are so lucky. What kind of magic do you use?"

Neri hesitated for a moment, then replied, "My element is Earth. I can control the ground beneath us, the trees, the stones… It's tied to the giant cherry blossom tree at the heart of our village. Our sacred tree grants us its strength."

Yome couldn't hide his admiration. "That sounds incredible. Your people must be really powerful."

Neri blushed at the praise, her tail swishing slightly behind her. "We… we do our best to protect our home. But we're not warriors like the elves. We prefer to avoid conflict whenever possible."

Elara smiled knowingly. "That's a wise approach. But it also makes me curious… why did you come so far down the mountain, knowing the dangers?"

Neri's expression darkened again, her ears flattening slightly. "I didn't know the Bloodmoon would rise. I just… I had to get those herbs. My village needs them, and… I thought I could handle it. But I was wrong."

Yome reached out, giving her a reassuring pat on the shoulder. "Don't blame yourself. None of us could have known about the Bloodmoon. What matters is that you're safe now, and we'll get you home."

Neri nodded, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Thank you, Yome. You're… very kind."

Elara gave Yome an approving look before standing up and dusting off her clothes. "Alright, we should get moving. We need to get you back to Blossom Garden, and we have a quest of our own to complete."

Neri's ears perked up at the mention of a quest. "A quest? What kind of quest?"

Elara smiled at her curiosity. "We're looking for something called the core. We think it's hidden somewhere in the mountains, possibly near your village. The inscription we found mentioned the place where the angel weeps for the fallen god. Does that sound familiar to you?"

Neri's eyes widened slightly. "The Crying Angel… Yes, I've heard of it. It's a legend among my people. They say there's a place in the mountains where an ancient statue of an angel weeps tears of sorrow. It's said to be the resting place of a fallen god… but no one knows where it is. It's a place of great mystery and power."

Yome and Elara exchanged a glance, the pieces of their quest starting to come together. "That must be it," Yome said, excitement building in his voice. "We're on the right track."

Elara nodded, then turned back to Neri. "It's not going to be easy, but with your help, I think we can find it. And we'll make sure you get home safely along the way."

Neri smiled, her heart swelling with hope. "Thank you… I'll do my best to help."

The party spent the next hour packing up their camp, making sure Neri was well enough to travel. Elara handed her a small vial of potion to help with any lingering pain from her wounds, while Yome rummaged through his pack and found a spare set of clothes—one of the space adventurer outfits he had picked up from the warrior statue earlier.

Neri hesitated as she took the outfit from Yome, her eyes widening slightly as she examined the strange material. "This… this is from another world, isn't it? I've never seen anything like it."

Yome chuckled, scratching the back of his head. "Yeah, it is. I'm not exactly from around here, either. But don't worry—it should be comfortable and keep you safe."

Neri looked up at him, her expression a mix of awe and curiosity. "You're… really not from here? That's incredible. I've never met anyone from another world before."

Elara smirked, leaning against a nearby tree. "Yome's full of surprises, isn't he?"

Yome blushed slightly, feeling a bit self-conscious under their gazes. "I'm just trying to get by, like everyone else."

Neri smiled warmly at him, her earlier fear and wariness finally fading away. "Thank you… both of you. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't found me."

Elara gave her a reassuring nod. "You're part of our party now, Neri. We look out for each other."

Once they were all packed and ready, the trio set off deeper into the forest. The morning sun had risen higher in the sky, casting a golden hue over the trees...

### Chapter 11: The Bloodmoon’s Warning

The deeper they ventured into the forest, the thicker the canopy became. Sunlight struggled to penetrate through the dense leaves, and the once lively sounds of the forest gradually gave way to an eerie silence. The air grew cooler, and a faint mist began to swirl around their feet as they walked.

Neri, now dressed in the space adventurer outfit Yome had given her, moved with a renewed sense of purpose, though her eyes still darted nervously around at every sound. Elara walked ahead, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword, ever vigilant. Yome, though trying to appear confident, couldn't shake the tension gnawing at his gut.

After a while, Yome broke the silence. "Neri, you mentioned your village, Blossom Garden. What's it like? It sounds beautiful."

Neri's expression softened at the mention of her home. "It is… It's the most beautiful place I've ever seen. The village is nestled high in the mountains, surrounded by lush greenery and blooming flowers. But what makes it truly special is the giant cherry blossom tree at the center. It's ancient, older than any of us, and its branches stretch out over the entire village, showering us with pink petals during the spring. We believe the tree is sacred, that it's connected to the spirits of the earth."

Yome listened intently, imagining the peaceful village she described. "It sounds like a paradise. I'd love to see it someday."

Neri smiled softly, a wistful look in her eyes. "You would be welcome there. The tree is the heart of our magic. It's said that each neko is born with a connection to a specific element, and that connection is strengthened by the tree. My element is Earth, so I can draw power from the ground, the trees, and the rocks. But there are others, too. My sister, for example, is connected to Water. She can summon rain or calm the rivers."

Yome was fascinated by her explanation. "So, you don't need a grimoire or anything like that? You can just… use magic?"

Neri nodded. "Yes, it's part of who we are. We train from a young age to control our powers, but we don't need to learn spells from books. It's instinctual, passed down through generations."

Elara, who had been quietly listening to their conversation, glanced back at Neri with interest. "That's similar to some of the magic among elves, though not all of us are born with such abilities. Those who are can be very powerful. You're fortunate to have such a connection to your element."

Neri's ears twitched slightly, and she smiled modestly. "I suppose I am. But it can be a heavy burden, too. We have a responsibility to protect the tree and the village. If something were to happen to it…"

She trailed off, her expression turning serious. Yome noticed the change and decided to shift the conversation slightly. "It sounds like your village is really important. But I'm curious, Neri… What do you know about the Bloodmoon? Why does it have such a powerful effect on the creatures here?"

Neri's eyes widened slightly at the mention of the Bloodmoon, and she shivered as if recalling the terror of the previous night. "The Bloodmoon… It's a rare event, but when it happens, it brings out the worst in the creatures of the forest. The moon turns red as blood, and its light drives them into a frenzy. The werewolves, especially, become more violent and uncontrollable. It's as if they lose their minds, consumed by bloodlust. Our elders say it's a curse, something left over from an ancient battle between the gods and the demons."

Elara nodded thoughtfully, her eyes narrowing slightly. "That would explain why the forest felt so different last night. The Bloodmoon must have heightened everything's aggression… But it also makes me wonder. If the Bloodmoon is so dangerous, why do people still venture out during it?"

Neri sighed softly, her ears drooping. "Most people don't. The Bloodmoon is unpredictable—it can happen without warning. That's why I didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. I was too focused on gathering the herbs I needed. By the time I realized, the moon was already rising, and I had to run for my life."

Yome felt a pang of guilt at her words. She had been out there all alone, facing unimaginable dangers while he and Elara were making their own way through the forest. He looked at Neri with renewed respect and empathy. "I'm sorry you had to go through that, Neri. But I'm glad you're safe now."

Neri looked up at him, her eyes shining with gratitude. "Thank you, Yome. I don't know what I would have done if you and Elara hadn't found me. I owe you both my life."

Elara gave a small smile, her voice firm yet gentle. "You don't owe us anything, Neri. We help each other out here. That's the only way to survive."

As they continued walking, the forest around them grew increasingly silent. The trees were taller here, their thick branches entwining overhead, blocking out most of the sunlight. The mist that had been swirling around their feet thickened, rising up to waist level, giving the forest an otherworldly feel. Every now and then, Yome caught sight of something moving in the fog—shadows darting between the trees, almost too quick to see. He felt a growing sense of unease.

After a while, Yome couldn't help but ask, "Neri… What's deeper in this forest? We've been walking for hours, but I haven't seen any signs of civilization. Just… more trees, and that mist."

Neri's ears twitched, and she glanced around nervously. "We're getting close to the swamp. The Bog of Mists is up ahead, and beyond that, the mountains. But you have to be careful in the swamp… It's full of traps, hidden dangers, and… other things."

Yome's heart skipped a beat at the mention of "other things." He was about to ask what she meant when she continued, her voice lower now.

"The witches live there. They're not like the werewolves—they're more cunning, more dangerous. They can use powerful spells, and they don't take kindly to intruders. If they see you, Yome… They might not let you leave."

Yome gulped, his mouth suddenly dry. "Witches? You mean like… real witches?"

Neri nodded, her expression serious. "Yes. They've lived in the swamp for centuries, isolated from the rest of the world. They're mistrustful of outsiders, especially humans. They still remember the days when humans hunted witches, burned them at the stake… They haven't forgiven or forgotten."

Yome's stomach twisted in fear. "That… doesn't sound good. But we have to go through the swamp, don't we?"

Elara sighed, her voice tinged with resignation. "Unfortunately, yes. It's the quickest route to the mountains, and we don't have time to go around. But we'll be careful. We've dealt with worse before."

Neri looked at Yome, her eyes full of concern. "You should be careful, Yome. The witches are powerful, and they can be unpredictable. If they see you as a threat…"

Yome forced a smile, trying to hide his fear. "I'll be careful, I promise. Besides, I have you and Elara to watch my back, right?"

Elara smirked, giving him a reassuring nod. "You're not alone in this, Yome. We'll get through it together."

The trio continued their journey in tense silence, the fog around them growing thicker with every step. The ground beneath their feet became softer, more treacherous, as they neared the edge of the swamp. The air grew colder, and the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filled their nostrils.

Finally, they reached the border of the Bog of Mists. The trees here were gnarled and twisted, their roots clawing into the muddy ground like skeletal fingers. The mist was so thick now that they could barely see a few feet ahead. It swirled around them, heavy with the promise of danger.

Yome felt a chill run down his spine as he gazed into the swamp. "This is it, isn't it? The Bog of Mists…"

Neri nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. "Yes… This is where the witches live."

Elara scanned the area, her eyes sharp and focused. "Stay close, both of you. We don't know what we're walking into."

They took a cautious step forward, the soft ground squelching beneath their boots. The air was thick with tension, every sound amplified by the eerie silence. Just as they were about to take another step, a low growl rumbled through the mist, freezing them in place.

Yome's heart pounded in his chest as he strained to see through the fog. The growl grew louder, closer, until finally, a pair of glowing eyes appeared in the mist, followed by a hulking figure.

A werewolf.

The creature's massive frame loomed before them, its fur bristling, teeth bared in a snarl. Its eyes locked onto Yome, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still.

Yome's breath caught in his throat as he realized the danger they were in. This wasn't just any werewolf—it was one still under the influence of the Bloodmoon, its aggression amplified to a terrifying degree.

### Chapter 12: The werewolf

Elara slowly drew her sword, the blade shimmering in the dim light that filtered through the thick mist. The werewolf's eyes darted to the weapon, its growl deepening as it lowered its body, preparing to lunge.

"Yome, stay behind me," Elara whispered, her voice tense but controlled. She shifted into a defensive stance, the tip of her sword aimed squarely at the werewolf.

Yome swallowed hard, his hands trembling slightly as he tried to think of what to do. He could see the muscles in the werewolf's legs tensing, ready to spring. Neri, who had been standing beside him, stepped closer, her eyes wide with fear but resolute.

"There's no reasoning with it," Neri whispered, her voice barely audible. "The Bloodmoon has driven it mad."

Elara nodded subtly, her gaze never leaving the werewolf. "When I give the signal, Yome, you and Neri run. Don't look back."

"But—" Yome started, his voice shaky, but Elara cut him off.

"No time for debate. Trust me, Yome. I'll hold it off."

Before Yome could protest further, the werewolf let out a deafening roar and launched itself at Elara. The ground shook beneath its weight as it closed the distance in a heartbeat, claws outstretched and jaws snapping.

Elara moved like lightning, her sword flashing as she sidestepped the initial attack. The blade cut through the werewolf's side, but the creature barely seemed to notice, its bloodlust driving it forward. It spun on its heel with a speed that belied its size, swiping at Elara with a massive paw. She parried the blow, but the sheer force of it sent her staggering back a few steps.

"Now, Yome!" Elara shouted, her voice strained as she prepared to block the werewolf's next assault.

Yome grabbed Neri's hand, his heart pounding as he pulled her away from the fight. "Come on, we have to move!"

Neri hesitated, her eyes flickering with worry as she glanced back at Elara. But she knew there was no time to argue, so she followed Yome as they bolted into the mist, their footsteps muffled by the thick, swampy ground.

The sounds of battle faded behind them as they ran, the fog swallowing up the noises of clashing steel and growling fury. The mist grew denser the further they went, until it was almost impossible to see more than a few feet ahead. The trees around them twisted into nightmarish shapes, their branches reaching out like skeletal arms.

"Yome… where are we going?" Neri panted, struggling to keep up with him as they navigated the treacherous terrain.

"I don't know, just… away from here!" Yome replied, his voice tight with fear. He could barely think straight, his mind racing with a thousand thoughts. Where could they go? How could they escape? And what about Elara? He wanted to go back, to help her, but he knew he'd be no match for a creature as fearsome as that werewolf.

As they stumbled through the swamp, the ground beneath them became softer, more unstable. Yome felt his foot sink into the mud with each step, and he had to pull hard to free himself. Neri, lighter and more agile, managed to avoid most of the deep patches, but even she was struggling.

"We need to find higher ground," Neri suggested, her voice tinged with desperation. "If we stay here, we'll get stuck in the mud."

Yome nodded, trying to peer through the mist for any sign of solid ground. But the fog was too thick, obscuring everything beyond a few feet. "I can't see anything! It's like this place is trying to trap us…"

Neri's ears perked up, and she glanced around, her nose twitching as she sniffed the air. "Wait… I think I smell something. Water, maybe a stream?"

Yome followed her lead, sniffing the air as well, but all he could detect was the damp, earthy scent of the swamp. "Are you sure? I can't smell anything."

Neri nodded, more certain now. "This way!" She pulled Yome in a new direction, her steps quicker and more confident.

As they moved, the ground began to slope upward slightly, and the mud grew firmer beneath their feet. After a few minutes, they emerged onto a small rise where the mist was thinner, allowing them to see a bit farther. In the distance, Yome could just make out the glint of water through the trees.

"There!" Neri pointed, a hint of relief in her voice. "If we can reach that stream, we might be able to follow it out of the swamp."

Yome nodded, feeling a small flicker of hope. "Good idea. Let's hurry."

They scrambled down the rise, the ground growing more solid as they approached the water. The stream was narrow but fast-flowing, cutting through the swamp like a silver ribbon. Yome felt a rush of relief as he splashed into the shallows, the cold water refreshing against his legs.

Neri knelt beside the stream, cupping her hands to take a drink. "We should follow it upstream. It's bound to lead us somewhere safe."

Just as Yome was about to agree, a rustling sound in the bushes behind them made him freeze. He turned slowly, his heart skipping a beat as he saw a shadowy figure emerge from the mist.

For a moment, Yome's blood ran cold, thinking the werewolf had found them. But as the figure stepped closer, he realized it was Elara, limping slightly but otherwise unhurt. She was covered in mud and scratches, but her expression was one of grim determination.

"Elara!" Yome shouted, relief flooding through him as he rushed over to her. "Are you okay? What happened?"

Elara nodded, wiping sweat and dirt from her brow. "I'm fine. The werewolf… it's gone. I managed to wound it enough that it fled back into the forest. But it won't be the last one we encounter."

Neri looked at Elara with wide eyes, admiration and concern mingling in her gaze. "You're amazing… I can't believe you fought it off."

Elara shook her head, a tired smile tugging at her lips. "It was luck more than anything. But we need to keep moving. This swamp is full of dangers, and the witches are still out there."

Yome felt a new surge of determination as he looked between his companions. They were battered and tired, but they were still standing. "Right. Let's follow the stream and see where it leads. We'll get out of this swamp together."

They began to walk along the stream, the sound of rushing water a comforting presence amidst the eerie silence of the swamp. The mist slowly began to thin as they moved, and the trees became less twisted, their branches no longer clawing at the sky.

### Chapter 13: The witch

As they walked along the stream, Yome found himself glancing over at Neri, her earlier words about the witches still ringing in his ears. He couldn't help but wonder about the magic she had mentioned—the ancient spells passed down through generations. How powerful were these witches, and what would they do if they encountered them?

"Neri," Yome began hesitantly, breaking the silence. "You said the witches are dangerous… but do you think they'd listen to us? If we tried to talk to them?"

Neri's expression darkened, and she shook her head slowly. "I don't know. They're not like the werewolves—they're not driven by instinct or rage. They're intelligent, but that makes them even more unpredictable. If they see us as a threat… they might not give us a chance to speak."

Elara, who had been listening closely, nodded in agreement. "Witches are known for their cunning. They might listen to us, but they could just as easily decide to use us for their own purposes. We have to be careful."

Yome felt a knot of worry tighten in his chest. He didn't want to think about what could happen if they encountered the witches, but he knew they had to be prepared for anything. "We'll be careful," he said, more to himself than to the others.

As they continued to follow the stream, the landscape gradually began to change. The swampy ground gave way to more solid earth, and the trees became taller and less twisted. The mist that had clung to them for so long started to dissipate, revealing more of the forest around them.

Yome couldn't help but feel a small sense of relief as the oppressive atmosphere of the swamp began to lift. But that relief was short-lived. Just as they thought they might be out of danger, a soft, melodic voice echoed through the trees.

"Well, well… What do we have here?"

The voice was calm, almost playful, but there was an underlying edge to it that made Yome's skin crawl. He turned slowly, his heart pounding, to see a figure stepping out from behind one of the trees.

It was a woman, tall and graceful, with long, flowing hair that seemed to shimmer in the dappled sunlight. Her eyes were a striking shade of green, and her lips curled into a knowing smile as she regarded them.

Elara immediately moved in front of Yome and Neri, her hand tightening around her sword. "Who are you?"

The woman's smile widened, revealing sharp, pointed teeth. "Oh, don't be so hostile, dear. I'm just a traveler, like you."

Neri's ears flattened against her head, and she whispered urgently to Yome, "She's one of them… a witch."

Yome felt his heart skip a beat as he realized the gravity of the situation. The witch's smile remained, but there was a flicker of something darker in her eyes—something that sent a chill down his spine.

Elara's stance remained defensive, her voice firm as she addressed the witch. "We don't want any trouble. We're just passing through."

The witch chuckled softly, the sound like the tinkling of glass. "Oh, I'm sure you are. But trouble… well, it has a way of finding those who wander where they shouldn't."

Yome felt the air around them grow colder, the shadows of the forest seeming to stretch and twist as if alive. The sense of unease he had felt earlier returned tenfold, settling heavily in his chest.

"Let us pass," Elara demanded, her tone leaving no room for negotiation.

The witch tilted her head, considering them for a moment, before her smile widened. "Perhaps I will… but that depends on how interesting you can make it for me."

Before anyone could respond, there was a sudden rustling in the bushes behind them. Yome turned just in time to see another shadowy figure emerging from the mist, its form hulking and feral. His breath caught in his throat as he recognized the familiar, fearsome shape—a werewolf, its eyes glowing with an unnatural light.

The witch's smile turned into a full grin, her eyes gleaming with dark amusement. "Ah, it seems the fun is just beginning."

Elara's grip on her sword tightened, her eyes darting between the witch and the werewolf. "Yome, Neri—stay close to me," she commanded, her voice low but urgent.

The werewolf growled, its claws digging into the earth as it began to circle them, its gaze fixed on Yome. He could feel the panic rising in his throat, but he forced himself to stay calm. They had faced danger before, and they had survived. They would survive this too.

The witch watched them with interest, her expression unreadable. "Well, what will it be? Fight or flight?" she mused, clearly enjoying their predicament.

Yome's mind raced, searching for a way out, for something that could tip the balance in their favor. But before he could come up with a plan, the werewolf lunged, its powerful body moving with terrifying speed.
