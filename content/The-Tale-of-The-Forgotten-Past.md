### Prologue

Yome, a young construction worker in his mid-twenties, trudges through life burdened by the monotony of his daily routine. With little education, no family, and only the backbreaking work on construction sites to keep him occupied, Yome watches enviously as his peers live out their vibrant lives. Every day blends into the next, until one fateful moment changes everything.

While working on a high-rise, Yome's safety rope snaps, sending him plummeting towards certain death. As he falls, a lifetime of regrets and unfulfilled dreams flash before his eyes. "Am I dead? Too soon? No, I was already living like a corpse... This is for the better," he muses. Just as he resigns himself to his fate, a blinding light envelops him.

A mystical voice echoes through the light, declaring, "Your story is just starting..."

Awakening in a fantastical world teeming with magic, mythical creatures, and ancient mysteries, Yome finds himself given a second chance. But this new realm is not without its own perils. As Yome navigates through enchanted forests, treacherous mountains, and forgotten ruins, he must uncover the secrets of a lost civilization and his own latent powers.

Haunted by his past and driven by an unyielding desire for purpose, Yome embarks on an epic journey of self-discovery, courage, and transformation. The road ahead is fraught with danger and wonder, where allies and enemies are not always as they seem.

In a land where the lines between legend and reality blur, Yome must rise to the challenge, or risk becoming a forgotten soul once more. "The Tale of the Forgotten Past" is a spellbinding adventure that explores the resilience of the human spirit, the quest for redemption, and the power of a second chance....

### The Mysterious Fort and My Unique Skill

Yome's eyes flickered open to a dim, cold light. He groaned, feeling the chill of stone beneath him. As he sat up, a wave of confusion washed over him. The last thing he remembered was falling, the wind rushing past him, and then the light… the voice.

"Where am I?" he muttered, rubbing his temples. The room around him was vast, ancient, and crumbling. Tall, shadowy figures loomed over him — statues of warriors long forgotten. The air was heavy with the scent of dust and decay.

Yome staggered to his feet, noticing his clothes had changed. He wore a simple tunic and trousers, much different from his work clothes. His hands, once calloused and scarred from years of labor, now looked cleaner, stronger.

"What is this place?" he whispered, his voice echoing through the empty hall. He took a tentative step forward, the ground crunching beneath his feet. The hall opened into a vast chamber filled with rows of ancient bookshelves. Broken weapons and pieces of armor littered the floor.

"Hello?" he called out, but only silence answered.

He moved deeper into the chamber, every sound amplified in the eerie quiet. Suddenly, a noise made him spin around, heart pounding. A creature lunged from the shadows, its eyes gleaming with hunger. Yome grabbed a broken sword from the ground and swung it with all his might. The creature screeched and fell back, but others began to emerge from the darkness.

For three days, Yome fought for his life against these relentless monsters. Each encounter left him more exhausted and desperate. He scavenged for food and water, finding little sustenance among the ruins. Sleep was fitful, with nightmares of his fall and the voice haunting him.

On the third day, while searching for a safe place to rest, he stumbled upon a hidden door in the library. Pushing it open, he found a small, dimly lit room filled with ancient tomes and scrolls. At the center of the room, on a pedestal, lay a book unlike any other he had seen — a Grimoire.

"What's this?" Yome muttered, stepping closer. The book seemed to pulse with a faint, green light. He hesitated, then reached out and touched it. Instantly, the room was filled with a blinding light, and knowledge flooded his mind.

As the light faded, Yome found himself holding the Grimoire. He could feel its power, and his mind buzzed with new information. The Grimoire was a Base level, capable of holding six skills. And it was not just any Grimoire; it contained the element of wind.

"Skills… magic?" he murmured, flipping through the pages. He found descriptions of various spells and their mana consumption. One skill caught his eye: Predict. It was a rare ability that allowed him to predict an enemy's actions five seconds into the future, usable three times a day at the cost of 50 mana each time.

"This could save my life," he said, determination hardening his voice. He focused on the Grimoire, feeling a connection form between them. Mana coursed through him, and he realized he could now sense its flow within his body.

Suddenly, the Grimoire glowed brighter, and Yome felt a sharp pain in his chest. He gasped, dropping to his knees as visions of his past flashed before his eyes. Then, just as suddenly, the pain vanished. When he opened his eyes, he saw a new entry in the Grimoire: a unique skill.

"Status," he whispered, and a translucent screen appeared before his eyes.

He stared at the screen in awe. "So, I'm really in a different world," he murmured. "A world with magic and… monsters." He glanced at the broken sword in his hand and then back at the Grimoire. "I need to learn more about this place."

Armed with his new knowledge, Yome ventured out of the library. The creatures were waiting, but this time he was prepared. He whispered the incantation for a wind blade, and a gust of sharp air sliced through the first monster.

"Yes!" he shouted triumphantly, but the fight was far from over. As more creatures charged, he used Predict to anticipate their movements. The world seemed to slow down, and he moved with newfound agility, dodging attacks and striking back with precision.

Despite his limited mana and the need for caution, Yome felt a spark of hope. For the first time since his fall, he believed he could survive.

After days of relentless battle, Yome finally found a place to rest in the abandoned city surrounding the fort. He set up camp in a small, sheltered courtyard, lighting a fire to keep the night's chill at bay.

As he stared into the flames, his mind raced with questions. "Why am I here? What is this world?" he wondered aloud. The voice that had spoken to him before his fall echoed in his memory. "Your story is just starting…"

"What story?" he muttered, frustration creeping into his voice. "I need answers."

Suddenly, a movement caught his eye. A shadowy figure stood at the edge of the courtyard, watching him. Yome's heart skipped a beat as he reached for his broken sword, ready for another fight.

"Who's there?" he called out, but the figure remained silent...

### The Unknown Shadow

Yome's eyes were fixed on the shadowy figure at the edge of the courtyard. Heart pounding, he clutched his broken sword tightly, preparing for another fight. The figure moved with fluid grace, stepping into the dim light of the fire.

"Who's there?" Yome called out again, but the figure remained silent, its presence imposing and mysterious.

Fear mingled with determination as Yome charged at the shadow with all his might. "I won't go down without a fight!" he shouted, swinging his sword wildly. The figure dodged effortlessly, countering with precise strikes. Their blades clashed, creating sparks that illuminated their fierce battle.

Hours seemed to pass as they fought. Yome's muscles screamed in protest, his breath coming in ragged gasps. His mana was nearly depleted, the Predict skill having given him only slight advantages in predicting the figure's movements. Despite his best efforts, the figure's skill and agility were overwhelming.

Finally, with a swift strike, the shadowy figure disarmed Yome, sending his broken sword flying. Exhausted and defeated, Yome fell to the ground, gasping for breath. The figure stood over him, sword pointed directly at his face.

"Finish it," Yome panted, closing his eyes and bracing for the end.

Instead of a killing blow, he heard a soft rustle. Opening his eyes, Yome saw the figure removing a mask. He blinked in astonishment as a beautiful elf woman with crystal blue eyes, pointy ears, and long blonde hair appeared before him. She looked like a goddess, her presence both intimidating and captivating.

"Who are you?" she demanded, her voice sharp and clear. "And what are you doing in this abandoned city?"

Yome struggled to sit up, wincing in pain. "My name is Yome. I'm… I'm human."

The elf woman's eyes widened in shock. "Human? But humanity was wiped out long ago. How did you get here?"

"I don't know," Yome admitted, his voice trembling. "I was working on a construction site, fell, and then… I woke up here. I don't even know what this place is."

The elf woman's expression softened slightly. "I am Elara, a warrior of the Elven Tribes. We thought humans were extinct, along with many of our own kind, wiped out by the Demon King."

"Demon King?" Yome echoed, feeling a chill run down his spine.

Elara nodded. "Yes. He's a mysterious and powerful being. No one knows who he is or where he came from, but he unleashed chaos upon this world, filling it with deadly monsters and destroying entire civilizations. Only a few elf tribes and hybrids remain."

Yome felt a surge of despair. "So, I'm alone in a world filled with monsters?"

Elara's gaze softened further. "Not entirely alone. But we must hurry. It will be Blood Moon in a couple of hours. The monsters will become three times stronger and more aggressive. You won't survive here without protection."

She sheathed her sword and extended a hand to Yome. "Come with me. We need to leave this city and find a safer place."

Grateful and exhausted, Yome took her hand, allowing her to help him up. As they gathered their belongings, Yome glanced at Elara's Grimoire. It was a second-level Grimoire, fire element, radiating a powerful aura.

Elara glanced at Yome's broken sword and sighed. "We'll need to find you a proper weapon. This won't do."

Yome nodded, feeling a mix of gratitude and unease. "Thank you for helping me. I don't know what I would've done without you."

Elara smiled faintly. "We elves have a saying: 'In darkness, find the light.' Perhaps you are the light we need."

They packed their bags quickly, preparing to leave the city before the Blood Moon rose. As they moved through the crumbling streets, Yome couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope amidst the overwhelming uncertainty. He had found an ally in this strange new world, and together. They are stepping out of the abandoned city, the Blood Moon rising ominously in the sky, and the distant howls of monsters echoing through the night. Their journey had just begun, and the road ahead was fraught with danger and discovery...

### The Blood Moon and the Bloodwolf Herd

The air was thick with tension as Yome and Elara made their way through the deserted city. The buildings around them were crumbling, remnants of a once-thriving civilization. Shadows danced in the corners of Yome's vision, making him jump at every small sound. 

As they walked, Yome couldn't help but ask questions, his curiosity burning despite the danger.

"Elara," Yome began, glancing at her. "What happened here? How did the humans and elves get wiped out? And who exactly is the Demon King?"

Elara's expression darkened as she prepared to respond, but before she could speak, a low growl echoed through the empty streets. Yome and Elara turned to see a herd of monstrous wolves with glowing red eyes emerging from the shadows. Their fur was dark and matted, and their teeth glowed with an eerie, fiery light.

"Bloodwolves!" Elara exclaimed, drawing her enchanted sword. "Stay close to me, Yome. These beasts are incredibly dangerous, especially under the Blood Moon."

Yome nodded, gripping his broken sword tightly. The wolves circled them, their growls growing louder. The leader of the pack lunged at Yome, but he managed to dodge just in time. Remembering his training over the past few days, he summoned his wind blade.

"Wind Blade!" Yome shouted, slashing at the nearest wolf. The gust of sharp air cut through the beast, making it yelp and fall back.

Elara engaged the other wolves, her sword blazing with fire. She moved with grace and precision, dispatching the monsters with ease. Yome was in awe of her skill, but he couldn't afford to be distracted. Another wolf lunged at him, and he quickly activated Wind Step to dodge the attack, moving with a burst of wind-powered speed.

"Gale Barrier!" he called out, forming a defensive shield of wind around himself as more wolves charged.

As Yome fought, he felt a surge of energy. He remembered his unique skill, Echo of the Fallen. Seeing an opportunity, he defeated one of the wolves and activated the skill.

"Echo of the Fallen!" he cried, feeling a rush of mana as he tried to absorb the wolf's power. A screen appeared before him, showing the new skill: Firebite. But as he tried to integrate it, he felt a sharp pain, and the skill was rejected.

"What's happening?" he gasped, his mana returning to normal as the absorption failed.

Elara noticed his struggle and shouted, "Yome, your Grimoire is wind-based! You can't use fire element skills with it!"

The remaining wolves seemed to sense their hesitation and attacked more fiercely. Yome gritted his teeth, focusing on his wind-based skills. He used Wind Blade and Gale Barrier repeatedly, his movements becoming more fluid and confident.

Elara, seeing Yome hold his ground, unleashed her powerful fire skills. "Flame Burst!" she shouted, sending a wave of fire that incinerated several wolves at once. The leader of the pack lunged at her, but she countered with Inferno Strike, burning it to ash.

Finally, the herd was defeated, their bodies littering the ground. Yome collapsed to his knees, exhausted and breathing heavily. Elara sheathed her sword and walked over to him.

"Are you alright?" she asked, helping him to his feet.

"I think so," Yome panted. "But why couldn't I use that skill? What's wrong with my Grimoire?"

Elara sighed and began to explain. "Your Grimoire is at the Base level and aligned with the wind element. At this level, you can only use skills related to that element. Echo of the Fallen allows you to absorb skills, but you can't use those that don't match your Grimoire's element."

"So I can only use wind skills?" Yome asked, feeling a bit disappointed.

"For now, yes," Elara confirmed. "As you level up your Grimoire, you'll be able to use more elements. Each level increases the number of skills you can hold and the variety of elements you can use. When you reach the next level, you can merge your Grimoire with another higher-level one, allowing you to use multiple elements."

Yome nodded, absorbing the information. "How do I level up my Grimoire?"

"You need to merge it with a higher-level Grimoire," Elara explained. "But it can't clash with your rank. As you gain experience and complete challenges, you'll earn the right to higher-ranked Grimoires."

Yome glanced at his Grimoire, feeling a mix of frustration and determination. "I'll get there," he vowed. "I'll become strong enough to use any skill I need."

Elara smiled at his resolve. "I believe you will. But for now, we need to keep moving. The Blood Moon is rising, and we're not safe yet."

They quickly gathered their belongings and set off again, making their way through the deserted streets. The city's eerie silence was occasionally broken by distant howls, reminding them of the dangers lurking in the shadows.

As they reached the midway point of their journey, Yome couldn't help but ask more questions. "Elara, can you tell me more about the Demon King?"

Elara's expression grew grim. "The Demon King is a powerful and mysterious entity. No one knows where he came from, but he unleashed chaos upon our world, filling it with deadly monsters and destroying entire civilizations. Most of humanity was wiped out, and many elf tribes were also decimated."

"Why does he do it?" Yome asked, his curiosity piqued.

"No one knows," Elara replied, her voice tinged with sadness. "Some say he seeks to control the world, others believe he revels in destruction. Whatever his motives, he's a threat to all living beings."

Yome felt a chill run down his spine. "And no one knows where he is?"

Elara shook her head. "Many have tried to find him, but none have succeeded."

They walked in silence for a while, the weight of the information heavy on Yome's mind. He glanced at Elara, admiring her strength and determination. Despite the bleakness of their situation, she remained resolute.

Finally, they reached the midway point of their journey, stopping to rest briefly. Elara handed Yome some food and water, which he accepted gratefully.

"We'll make it through this," Elara said, her voice filled with determination. "We have to."

Yome nodded, feeling a renewed sense of purpose. "We will. Together."

### The Guild

The dawn was breaking, and the ominous red glow of the Blood Moon was fading. Yome and Elara continued their journey through the deserted city, the eerie silence occasionally broken by the distant howls of monsters. Exhaustion weighed heavily on them both, their mana reserves nearly depleted. Despite this, they pressed on, determined to find safety before the next wave of attacks.

As they navigated the crumbling streets, a variety of beasts and monsters sporadically appeared, forcing them into brief skirmishes. Elara's fire spells were becoming weaker, and Yome's wind abilities were barely sustaining them.

"Stay close, Yome," Elara instructed, her voice strained. "We're almost out of here."

Yome nodded, panting from exertion. "I don't know how much longer I can keep this up."

Just as hope seemed within reach, a massive, hulking figure emerged from the shadows—a Level B monster. Its eyes glowed with malevolence, and its roar shook the very ground they stood on.

"Run!" Elara shouted, grabbing Yome's arm. They sprinted through the labyrinth of broken buildings, the monster hot on their heels. Every step sent a jolt of fear through Yome, but he forced himself to keep moving.

They ducked into a narrow alley and found themselves in front of a dilapidated building. Desperate, they burst through the door and slammed it shut behind them. The monster's roars echoed outside, but it didn't seem to follow them inside.

Catching their breath, they realized they had stumbled into an old guild building. Dust and cobwebs covered the remnants of a once-bustling place. Broken furniture and shattered glass littered the floor, but there was an unmistakable sense of history in the air.

"What is this place?" Yome asked, looking around in awe.

Elara brushed some dust off an old emblem on the wall. "This used to be a guild hall. Adventurers would come here to form parties, take on quests, and level up. It was a place of camaraderie and challenge."

"Guilds?" Yome echoed. "What are they exactly?"

Elara smiled, despite their situation. "Guilds are organizations that adventurers join to take on missions and quests. They provide resources, training, and a place to gather. Members are ranked based on their experience and accomplishments. The ranks range from novice to master."

Yome's curiosity grew. "How do you become an adventurer?"

"You need to register with a guild using a registration artifact called a Register Ball," Elara explained. "It records your status, skills, and achievements, allowing you to level up and gain access to more powerful quests and resources."

As if on cue, a soft glow caught their attention. In the center of a broken table lay a glowing white ball. Elara's eyes widened in surprise. "That's a Register Ball! I can't believe it's still here."

They approached the table, and Elara picked up the ball, handing it to Yome. "Place your hand on it and state your name."

Yome did as instructed, feeling a warm sensation spread through his body as the ball recorded his information. A translucent screen appeared before his eyes.

Yome's eyes widened as he saw his level. "I leveled up! But how?"

Elara smiled, placing her hand on the Register Ball to update her status. "We gained experience from the monsters we defeated during the night. The Register Ball calculates and updates our levels based on our achievements."

Her own screen appeared:

"We both leveled up significantly," Elara said, her tone one of cautious optimism. "This will help us survive."

They explored the guild hall further, discovering a cache of gear and supplies. Yome found a well-crafted sword and new clothes, replacing his worn and broken equipment. Elara handed him a set of leather armor that fit him surprisingly well.

"This should offer you better protection," she said, adjusting the armor on him.

Yome nodded, feeling more prepared. "Thank you, Elara. I don't know what I'd do without you."

"We're in this together," she replied, giving him a reassuring smile. "Now let's see what else we can find."

On a dusty shelf, they discovered potions and other supplies. Elara handed Yome several healing potions and mana potions, explaining their use.

"These will help you recover during battles. Healing potions restore health, and mana potions replenish your magical energy."

Yome stored the potions in his inventory, feeling more confident about their chances. "This place is a treasure trove," he remarked, looking around.

Elara nodded. "Old guild halls often have useful supplies left behind. We're lucky to have found this one."

With their newfound gear and resources, they decided to rest in the guild hall for the remainder of the day. They set up a small camp in one of the rooms, grateful for a moment of respite.

As Yome lay down, exhaustion finally overtook him. His thoughts swirled with the events of the past days—falling into a new world, fighting monsters, and discovering magic. Despite the fear and uncertainty, he felt a spark of hope. With Elara by his side, he believed they could survive and uncover the mysteries of this world. The dawn of a new day brought promise and peril in equal measure, but together, they were ready to face whatever lay ahead.

### The Temple and the Abyss

The first light of dawn cast a warm glow over the deserted city, heralding the start of a new day. Yome and Elara had rested well in the safety of the old guild hall, their strength renewed. They gathered their belongings and prepared to continue their journey.

As they stepped out into the streets, Yome noticed an unusual calm. "There don't seem to be as many monsters around today," he remarked, looking around warily.

Elara nodded, her expression thoughtful. "It's because of the Blood Moon. Most monsters are exhausted after the night's frenzy and need to rest during the day to recover. We'll have a bit of respite, but we should still be cautious."

Yome listened intently as they walked, eager to learn more about this new world. "You mentioned something about cycles last night. Can you explain them to me?"

"Of course," Elara replied. "The day cycle affects the strength and behavior of monsters. During the day, they are generally weaker and less aggressive. At night, especially during a Blood Moon, they become much stronger and more dangerous."

"And what about mana?" Yome asked, curious.

"Mana has its own cycle as well," Elara explained. "During the day, mana regenerates more slowly. At night, the mana flow is stronger, especially during special events like the Blood Moon or a Mana Surge, when magical abilities are significantly enhanced."

As they continued their conversation, Yome couldn't help but notice Elara's height. She was tall and elegant, her long blonde hair catching the sunlight. "You're quite tall," he said, giving her a playful smile. "And, if I may say, very beautiful."

Elara blushed deeply, clearly flustered by the compliment. "Oh, um, thank you, Yome." In her embarrassment, she accidentally activated her Flame Burst skill. A burst of fire erupted around her, sending Yome flying into a nearby building with a crash.

"Oh no!" Elara exclaimed, rushing over to him. "Are you alright? I'm so sorry, Yome!"

Yome groaned, sitting up amid the rubble with a wry smile. "I'm fine, really. That was quite the compliment you returned."

Elara giggled nervously, helping him to his feet. "I need to be more careful. Let's check out this building. It looks like an old temple."

Yome nodded, brushing off the dust. They entered the temple, the air inside cool and still. The interior was dark and filled with ancient carvings and statues, some of which had crumbled with age.

"Should we look for loot?" Yome asked, glancing around the eerie space.

"Yes," Elara replied. "Old temples often have hidden treasures or artifacts. Let's see what we can find."

They explored the temple carefully, searching for anything valuable. As they moved through the halls, Yome asked, "Elara, why were you in the city?"

Elara's expression grew serious. "Well um... Several members of my tribe have gone missing recently. We fear they might have been captured or worse. I came here to search for any clues or signs of them. It's dangerous, but I had to try."

Yome felt a surge of admiration for her bravery. "Your tribe must be very important to you."

"They are," Elara said softly. "We live in a distant forest, hidden from most of the world. We've tried to maintain our way of life despite the dangers. Our history is long and filled with strife, but we've always endured."

As Elara spoke, they continued their search. They found a few ancient artifacts and some useful items, including a small cache of potions. Yome added them to their inventory, grateful for the extra supplies.

Just as they were about to leave, the floor beneath them creaked ominously. Before they could react, the ground gave way, and they plunged into a black abyss below.

Yome's heart raced as they fell, the darkness swallowing them. He reached out, trying to grasp anything to slow their descent, but it was futile. Elara's scream echoed in his ears, mingling with his own shout of fear.

### The Dungeon of the Red Stone

Yome groaned as he slowly regained consciousness, his body aching from the fall. The darkness around him was oppressive, broken only by the faint glow of distant crystals embedded in the walls. As his senses returned, he became aware of something warm and soft pressing against his face. Blinking in confusion, he realized with a shock that Elara's chest was resting on him, her long blonde hair cascading over his shoulders.

His face flushed red in an instant. "W-What the—?!" Yome stammered, his voice barely a whisper.

Elara stirred at the sound, her eyelids fluttering open. As she registered their position, her eyes widened in horror, and she scrambled off him with a yelp. "I-I'm so sorry, Yome! I didn't mean to—"

"It's fine! Really, it's fine!" Yome quickly assured her, his own embarrassment just as evident. He sat up, trying to steady his racing heart. "It was just an accident. Let's not worry about it."

Elara, still blushing furiously, nodded in agreement. "Yes, let's… let's focus on our surroundings."

They both stood, taking a moment to assess where they had landed. The area was dimly lit by glowing crystals protruding from the walls, casting eerie shadows on the stone floor. The air was damp and cold, carrying the unmistakable scent of earth and decay.

"This looks like… a dungeon," Yome murmured, his voice tinged with unease.

Elara nodded, her eyes scanning the dark corridors that stretched out before them. "It seems so. But I can't tell what type of dungeon this is or how many monsters might be lurking within."

A faint, distant noise reached their ears—a low growl, followed by the sound of something dragging across the floor. Yome's stomach tightened in fear, and he gulped audibly. "Is there any way to get out of here without going deeper?" he asked, a note of desperation creeping into his voice.

Elara shook her head solemnly. "The only way out is through. We'll have to explore this dungeon and find an exit. But stay close to me, Yome. We don't know what dangers lie ahead."

Reluctantly, Yome nodded, gripping his newly acquired sword. "Okay… let's get moving."

They began their cautious descent into the dungeon, their footsteps echoing in the narrow corridors. The crystals lining the walls provided just enough light to reveal the path ahead, but the darkness beyond remained impenetrable.

As they ventured deeper, the faint glow of the crystals revealed more details of their surroundings. The walls were lined with ancient carvings, worn down by time, depicting scenes of battle and sacrifice. Yome's imagination ran wild, envisioning the horrors that might have taken place in these very halls.

Suddenly, they came across a small pack of goblins lurking in the shadows. The goblins were small, green-skinned creatures with sharp teeth and beady eyes. Most of them wielded crude weapons made of bone and stone. Yome tensed, his grip tightening on his sword.

"Goblins," Elara whispered, her voice steady. "They're low-level monsters. We can handle them."

Yome nodded, his confidence bolstered by her words. They moved forward, engaging the goblins in combat. Elara's sword blazed with fire as she cut through the creatures with ease, while Yome used his Wind Blade skill to slice through their ranks.

"Wind Blade!" Yome shouted, sending a gust of razor-sharp wind toward the goblins. The attack struck true, taking down two of the creatures in one swift motion. The remaining goblins snarled and charged, but they were no match for Elara's fire-based attacks.

As the last goblin fell, Yome noticed something unusual. One of the goblins, unlike the others, had used a wind-based attack during the fight. Goblins were typically associated with the earth element, so this anomaly caught his attention.

"That goblin… it was wind-type," Yome observed, intrigued.

Elara frowned. "That's unusual. Goblins are almost always earth-aligned. This one must have been mutated or exposed to some kind of magical influence."

Yome saw an opportunity. "Echo of the Fallen," he whispered, activating his unique skill. He focused on the fallen wind-type goblin, feeling the rush of mana as he attempted to absorb its knowledge.

A translucent screen appeared before him, revealing the new skill:


**Name**: Yome

**New Skill**: Wind Cutter (Wind Element) - A concentrated slash of wind that can cut through solid objects. (Mana Cost: 25)


"Got it," Yome said, a satisfied grin on his face. "Wind Cutter. This could come in handy."

They collected the loot from the defeated goblins, finding a few small items, including an ancient script. The parchment was old and worn, the text faded and written in an unknown language.

"This script… it's too old to decipher," Elara mused, examining the parchment closely. "But it could be important. We should hold onto it."

Yome nodded and placed the script into his inventory. "Maybe we'll find someone who can read it later."

They continued deeper into the dungeon, the air growing colder with each step. The dim light from the crystals flickered, casting eerie shadows that danced along the walls. The sense of foreboding grew stronger, and Yome couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched.

As they rounded a corner, they entered a vast chamber. At the center of the room stood a towering statue of an ancient warrior, its features worn and weathered by time. The statue's most striking feature was the large red stone embedded in its chest, glowing faintly in the dim light.

The floor around the statue was littered with old weapons, armor, and various treasures. Yome's eyes widened at the sight, his heart racing with excitement. "Look at all this loot!" he exclaimed, unable to contain his enthusiasm.

Elara's expression turned serious. "Yome, be careful. This could be a trap."

But Yome's excitement got the better of him. Ignoring Elara's warning, he rushed toward the treasures, his hands reaching out to grab the nearest items. The moment his fingers brushed against the loot, the red stone in the statue's chest flared to life, glowing a brilliant crimson.

The ground beneath them rumbled, and before they could react, the treasures vanished, and the chamber's doors slammed shut with a thunderous crash.

"Oh no…" Yome muttered, realizing his mistake. "I should have listened."

Elara drew her sword, her eyes scanning the room for threats. "Get ready, Yome. Something's coming."

Their fears were confirmed as the ceiling above them opened, and dozens of headless warrior armors dropped into the room. The suits of armor clanked and rattled as they stood, their weapons raised in a menacing display. Though headless, they moved with an eerie precision, like zombified soldiers.

"There are so many of them…" Yome whispered, fear gripping his heart.

The headless warriors charged, their weapons swinging with deadly force. Yome and Elara fought back with all their might, using their skills, weapons, and potions to fend off the relentless assault.

"Wind Blade!" Yome shouted, cutting through a line of warriors with a powerful gust of wind. But for every warrior they defeated, more seemed to take their place.

"Flame Burst!" Elara called out, unleashing a wave of fire that incinerated several warriors at once. But the strain was beginning to show—her mana was running low, and her movements were becoming sluggish.

The battle raged on, the chamber filled with the sounds of clashing metal and the groans of the undead. Yome's arms ached from swinging his sword, and his mana reserves were nearly depleted. Despite their best efforts, the sheer number of warriors was overwhelming.

"We can't keep this up!" Yome shouted, desperation in his voice.

Elara knew they were reaching their limits. Gritting her teeth, she decided to use her most powerful skill. "Dragon's Wrath!" she cried, her voice echoing through the chamber.

A surge of fiery energy erupted from Elara, enveloping her in a blazing aura. The flames intensified, forming the shape of a massive dragon that roared with fury. The dragon's fiery breath swept across the chamber, incinerating every headless warrior in its path.

The heat was intense, and Yome had to shield his eyes from the blinding light. When the flames finally subsided, the chamber was eerily silent. The headless warriors lay in smoldering heaps on the ground, their once-animated bodies now lifeless.

Elara collapsed to her knees, her energy completely spent. "I… I did it…" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Yome rushed to her side, supporting her as she struggled to stay upright. "You were amazing, Elara. But that was too much—are you okay?"

Elara gave him a weak smile. "I'll be fine… I just need to rest…"

Before they could catch their breath, they noticed the red stone in the statue's chest glowing even brighter. As they watched, the remaining headless warriors, which had not been caught in the initial blast, suddenly dropped to the ground, their weapons clattering as they fell.

"What's happening now?" Yome asked, his voice filled with apprehension.

"I don't know," Elara replied, her eyes fixed on the glowing stone. "But it feels like something's about to happen…"

### The Stone of the Flaming Dragon

The chamber's atmosphere grew thick with tension as the red stone embedded in the statue's chest began to glow brighter and brighter, casting an eerie crimson light across the room. Yome and Elara instinctively backed away from the statue, the intensity of the light making it difficult to look directly at it.

"Elara, what's happening?" Yome asked, his voice laced with concern.

"I don't know," Elara replied, her gaze fixed on the glowing stone. "But whatever it is, it's powerful. Stay back, Yome. I'll handle this."

Suddenly, a deep, resonant voice echoed throughout the chamber, filling the space with an otherworldly presence: "The one who wields the will of the hero… The one who unleashes the dragon… I shall guide you to the steps of the forgotten past."

The statue began to tremble violently, as if awakening from a long slumber. Before either of them could react, the red stone dislodged itself from the statue's chest and flew directly towards Elara. She gasped as it embedded itself into her necklace, which now held the glowing red stone at its center.

A window appeared before them:


**Artifact Unlocked: Stone of the Flaming Dragon**
- Type: Fire
- Power: Unknown
- Skill: Unknown


Elara stared at the stone in awe, her breath catching in her throat. "It… it's become part of my necklace," she whispered, touching the stone gingerly. "But what does it do?"

Driven by curiosity and a sense of urgency, Elara attempted to channel her mana into the stone to activate its power. However, as soon as she did, a sharp pain shot through her body, causing her to cry out in agony. The stone greedily drained her mana, and another window appeared:


**You are too weak to use this artifact.**


"Stop! Elara, stop!" Yome shouted, rushing to her side as she trembled in pain. He caught her just as her legs gave out, lowering her gently to the ground.

"I… I can't control it…" Elara gasped, her voice trembling as the pain finally subsided. The stone's glow dimmed, but it remained embedded in her necklace, a constant reminder of its mysterious power.

Yome quickly pulled out a health potion and a mana potion from his inventory, handing them to her. "Here, drink these. You need to recover."

Elara nodded weakly, accepting the potions with shaking hands. She drank them slowly, the effects gradually restoring her health and mana. Yome watched her closely, concern etched on his face.

After a few moments, she sighed deeply, feeling the potions' effects take hold. "Thank you, Yome. I'm sorry… I shouldn't have tried to use it."

"Don't apologize," Yome said gently, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "You couldn't have known what would happen. But we need to be careful with this artifact. It's clearly more powerful than we can handle right now."

Elara nodded, her expression somber. "You're right. We'll need to figure out how to control it, but for now… I'll keep it sealed."

They took a moment to rest and regroup, their bodies still weary from the intense battle and the strain of the artifact. Despite their fatigue, they knew they couldn't stay in the dungeon much longer. The ancient structure felt unstable, as if it could collapse at any moment.

"We should gather whatever loot we can and get out of here," Yome suggested, his voice steady despite his exhaustion.

Elara agreed, and together they began searching the chamber for any valuables. The battle with the headless warriors had left the room in disarray, but they managed to find several items of interest:

- Enchanted Gear: A set of armor pieces imbued with protective magic, enhancing their defense and agility.
- Gold Coins: A sizable amount of gold, likely from past adventurers who had perished in the dungeon.
- Ancient Scripts: More pieces of parchment filled with unknown symbols and text, too old and faded to decipher.
- Health Artifact: A small amulet that passively increases the rate of health regeneration.

Yome carefully added the items to his inventory, ensuring they didn't miss anything valuable. "These should come in handy," he said, admiring the enchanted gear before storing it away.

Elara nodded, her strength slowly returning. "Yes, they will. But we should be quick. I have a bad feeling about this place."

No sooner had the words left her mouth than the ground beneath them began to shake. Dust and debris fell from the ceiling as the walls of the chamber started to crack.

"The dungeon's collapsing!" Yome shouted, panic rising in his chest.

Suddenly, a new window appeared before them:


**Activating Safe Teleport…**


Without warning, a soft glow enveloped both Yome and Elara. The light grew brighter until it consumed them entirely, and in the next instant, they found themselves standing outside the dungeon, at the entrance of the temple.

The artifact that had triggered the teleportation glowed one last time before disintegrating into nothingness, leaving behind only the faintest trace of mana.

Yome let out a long sigh of relief, his legs nearly giving way beneath him. "We're out… Thank the gods, we're out."

Elara, still shaken from the ordeal, nodded in agreement. "That was close. Too close."

They took a moment to catch their breath, the cool night air a stark contrast to the oppressive atmosphere of the dungeon. The city lay quiet around them, the ruins bathed in the pale light of the rising moon.

"We've been in that dungeon for a while," Yome remarked, glancing at the sky. "I lost track of time in there."

Elara agreed, her gaze fixed on the forest that lay beyond the city's borders. "Let's move. We need to put some distance between us and the dungeon."

The pair crossed the city's border, leaving the ruins behind as they entered the dense forest. The trees were tall and ancient, their leaves rustling softly in the wind. A strange energy permeated the air, the mana so thick that Yome could almost feel it pressing against his skin.

"This forest… it's leaking a lot of mana," Yome observed, a shiver running down his spine. "It's making me nervous."

Elara's expression grew serious. "This is an old forest, one that's been untouched for centuries. The mana here is dense because it hasn't been disturbed. It can be both a blessing and a curse."

They continued their journey in silence, the only sounds being the soft crunch of leaves underfoot and the distant calls of nocturnal creatures. Despite the tranquility of the forest, Yome couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

He glanced at Elara and noticed the troubled look on her face. "Elara, are you alright? You've been quiet since we left the dungeon."

Elara hesitated before responding, her voice barely above a whisper. "When the stone embedded itself in my necklace, I saw something… something terrible."

Yome's brow furrowed with concern. "What did you see?"

Elara's eyes filled with a mix of fear and sorrow as she recounted her vision. "I saw a city in flames. Elves, humans… all screaming in fear and pain. Corpses littered the streets, their bodies torn apart by monstrous creatures. Children were running for their lives, but there was no escape. The monsters… they slaughtered everyone with no mercy."

Her voice trembled as she continued. "I saw an elf woman… She was bleeding heavily, one arm severed at the elbow. In her remaining hand, she held a broken sword, her eyes filled with despair. I think… I think it was a memory from the past. The past of the Demon King… but who was that woman? And why did the stone speak of a hero?"

Yome's heart ached for her as she struggled with the horrific vision. He placed a comforting hand on her shoulder, his voice gentle. "Elara, I can't imagine what you saw, but we'll figure this out. We'll learn more about this stone and the past… but for now, try not to dwell on it too much. Focus on your goal—finding your lost tribe members."

Elara nodded, though her expression remained haunted. "You're right. I need to stay strong, for their sake. Thank you, Yome."

As they continued through the forest, they eventually came across a small clearing by a lake. The water was still and reflective, mirroring the bright, full moon that hung high in the sky. The sight was serene, offering a brief moment of peace after the chaos they had endured.

"This looks like a good spot to rest," Yome suggested, already feeling the exhaustion from the day's events weighing on him.

Elara agreed, and they set up a small camp near the lake's edge. The cool breeze off the water was refreshing, and the sounds of the forest at night provided a calming backdrop.

They sat by the campfire, eating a simple dinner of dried meat and bread. Yome's mind wandered as he chewed, replaying the events of the day in his head. The battles, the discovery of the red stone, Elara's vision—it all seemed too much to take in.

To distract himself, he opened his inventory and began checking through the items they had collected in the dungeon. The enchanted gear they had found would serve them well in the future, and the health artifact was already making a difference in his recovery.

As Yome scrolled through his inventory, a sudden rustling sound came from the nearby bushes, breaking the serene atmosphere of the night. His head snapped up, eyes narrowing in the direction of the noise. The fire crackled softly, but all other sounds of the forest seemed to fall silent, as if the world itself was holding its breath.

"Elara," Yome whispered, his voice low and tense. "Did you hear that?"

Elara, who had been lost in thought, instantly snapped to attention. Her hand instinctively went to her sword, and her eyes scanned the darkness surrounding their camp. The rustling grew louder, more insistent, as if something—or someone—was moving toward them with purpose.

Yome stood slowly, careful not to make any sudden movements that might provoke whatever was out there. "Stay close to the fire," he murmured, trying to keep his voice steady. "It might be just an animal, but we can't take any chances."

Elara nodded, her expression calm but focused. "We've been through worse," she said, trying to offer some reassurance. "But let's be ready for anything."

The bushes rustled again, this time accompanied by a low growl. Yome tightened his grip on his sword, his mind racing. They had fought off goblins, headless warriors, and who knew what else in that dungeon. But out here, in the open, with their energy still sapped from the day's battles, the situation felt different. 

Elara shifted her stance, positioning herself between Yome and the direction of the sound. Her presence was both comforting and commanding, a silent reminder of the strength she possessed even after all they had endured. Yome, feeling a rush of determination, stood beside her, ready to face whatever emerged from the darkness.

The growl grew louder, more menacing, and then, without warning, a figure burst out of the bushes—a large, wolf-like creature with eyes that glowed an unnatural red. Its fur was matted and dark, and its fangs gleamed in the firelight as it snarled, baring its teeth at the two adventurers.

"A Bloodwolf," Elara hissed, recognizing the beast. "It's still lingering from the Blood Moon."

Yome's heart pounded in his chest. The last time they encountered these creatures, they had barely escaped with their lives. He quickly glanced at his mana reserves, knowing they were still low from the day's trials. There wasn't much left to draw from, but he had no choice.

"Elara, we need to take it down fast," Yome said, his voice firm despite the fear gnawing at him. "We can't afford a prolonged fight."

Elara nodded, already preparing herself for the battle. "Stay behind me and strike when you see an opening. I'll try to weaken it."

The Bloodwolf lunged, its claws extended and its jaws snapping with deadly intent. Elara was quicker, her enchanted sword blazing as she met the beast head-on. Sparks flew as their weapons clashed, and the Bloodwolf howled in pain as Elara's blade sliced through its fur.

Yome circled around, looking for an opportunity to strike. The wolf's movements were swift, almost too fast for him to keep up with, but he knew he had to act. With a surge of determination, he activated his "Wind Step", using the burst of speed to close the gap between him and the creature.

"Wind Blade!" Yome shouted, slashing at the Bloodwolf's side with all his strength. The gust of wind cut through the beast's flesh, drawing a deep wound that caused it to stagger.

But the Bloodwolf wasn't done yet. It turned on Yome with a vicious snarl, its glowing eyes filled with fury. Before it could strike, Elara was there, her sword flashing in the firelight as she delivered a powerful blow to the creature's head.

The Bloodwolf howled in agony, its body convulsing before it finally collapsed to the ground, defeated. Yome stood over it, breathing heavily, his heart still racing from the intensity of the fight.

"Is it dead?" he asked, not daring to lower his guard just yet.

Elara knelt beside the beast, inspecting it closely. After a moment, she nodded. "Yes, it's dead. But we need to stay vigilant. There could be more nearby."

Yome nodded, feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over him. "That was close… too close."

Elara placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. "You did well, Yome. We both did."

They took a moment to catch their breath, the tension slowly ebbing away as the adrenaline wore off. The campfire crackled softly, its warm light a stark contrast to the darkness that surrounded them.

"What do you think it was doing here?" Yome asked, breaking the silence. "I thought the Blood Moon's effect was over."

Elara shook her head, her expression thoughtful. "The Blood Moon may have passed, but some creatures are more resilient. They can linger for days, especially if they're particularly strong or stubborn. We need to be careful."

Yome nodded, grateful for her wisdom. "We should get some rest. We've been through a lot today, and we'll need our strength for whatever comes next."

Elara agreed, though she kept a wary eye on the forest. "We'll take turns keeping watch. Just in case."

They settled back by the fire, the tension from the battle still lingering but gradually fading into the background as the night wore on. The forest around them remained quiet, the only sound being the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.

As Yome lay down, trying to relax, he couldn't help but replay the events of the day in his mind. The dungeon, the red stone, the vision Elara had seen—it all felt like pieces of a much larger puzzle, one that they had only just begun to unravel.

He glanced at Elara, who was keeping watch with a calm but vigilant expression. Despite everything, she remained a steady presence, a beacon of strength and determination. Yome felt a deep sense of gratitude toward her, knowing that without her, he wouldn't have made it this far.

As he drifted off to sleep, Yome couldn't shake the feeling that their journey was only going to get more dangerous from here. But for now, at least, they were safe. And that was enough...

### To be continued...
